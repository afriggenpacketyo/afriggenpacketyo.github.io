          <p>A series of bear encounters across Japan has resulted in multiple injuries and at least one death. In one incident, a bear entered a grocery store in Numata, injuring two men before damaging property and frightening dozens of customers. Separately, a man was found dead from a suspected bear mauling on a mountain in the Iwate region, and other attacks have been reported. Experts attribute the rise in human-bear conflicts to factors like climate change impacting food sources and Japan's declining rural population, which allows bears to expand their habitat into previously human-occupied areas.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla, now a Category 2 storm, is gradually weakening but continues to pose a threat off the Pacific coast of Mexico. The storm is generating large swells and life-threatening surf conditions for southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula. A tropical storm watch is currently in effect for a portion of Baja California Sur. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Priscilla will move parallel to the coast without making landfall, with continued weakening expected over the next 48 hours as it moves northwest into the Pacific.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal case against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly making false statements to Congress is reportedly facing significant challenges. According to sources, the prosecution's central witness, Daniel Richman, told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information and, in fact, advised against it on several occasions. This testimony directly undermines the core of the indictment. Internal memos from career prosecutors allegedly warned that pursuing the case with this witness would present "insurmountable problems," raising doubts about the indictment's viability ahead of Comey's arraignment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The espionage case against two British men accused of spying for China has collapsed due to the government's failure to provide evidence officially labeling China a national security threat. The Director of Public Prosecutions explained that a legal precedent required this specific designation for a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Despite months of requests, witness statements from the government did not meet this new, higher evidentiary threshold. The failure to proceed with the trial has drawn criticism and raised questions about the government's official stance on China and its willingness to state it in a legal setting.</p>

          <p>Israeli naval forces have intercepted another aid flotilla attempting to breach the blockade of the Gaza Strip. The fleet, consisting of nine vessels carrying food, medical supplies, and 150 international activists, was stopped in international waters. Israel's foreign ministry described the incident as a "futile attempt to breach the legal naval blockade," confirming that the passengers are safe and will be deported. This action comes just a week after a similar, larger convoy was also stopped, highlighting the ongoing international efforts to deliver aid directly to Gaza amidst a dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $4,000 per ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets due to widespread economic and political instability. The rally is attributed to concerns over global trade disputes and delays in the release of key U.S. economic data caused by the ongoing government shutdown. Analysts note that central banks have also been significant buyers of gold, moving to diversify their reserves away from the U.S. dollar. While the current peak is driven by short-term uncertainty, the long-term trend is supported by strategic institutional purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed Assembly Bill 255, a bipartisan measure that would have allocated up to 10% of state homelessness funds for abstinence-based recovery housing. Newsom argued the bill was "unnecessary," stating that existing guidelines already permit sober living facilities. Proponents of the bill, however, contend that the state's rigid "Housing First" policy, which provides housing without sobriety requirements, has failed to address the addiction and mental health crises prevalent among the homeless population. The veto is criticized as an ideological decision that blocks a proven pathway to recovery for individuals struggling with substance use disorders.</p>

The indictment stems from his 2020 testimony where he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to serve as an anonymous media source. The prosecution is seen by critics as a significant step in Donald Trump's efforts to politicize the Justice Department, particularly after the previous U.S. attorney, who found insufficient evidence, was replaced by a Trump loyalist with no prosecutorial experience.</p>

Established by Alfred Nobel, the prize recognizes individuals or organizations for outstanding contributions to peace, fraternity between nations, and disarmament. The winner is selected by a Norwegian committee from a confidential list of over 330 nominees. While Trump has been nominated for his diplomatic efforts during his second term, experts believe the committee is unlikely to select him, though surprises, like Barack Obama's 2009 win, have occurred in the past.</p>

          <p>The pumpkin, a quintessential symbol of autumn, has a rich and complex history that traces back thousands of years in the Americas. Originally a vital food source for Indigenous peoples, the word itself evolved from the Greek 'pepon' and was later used by European settlers. For centuries, 'pumpkin' was also used as a derogatory term for a conceited or empty-headed person. However, by the late 19th century, it transformed into a symbol of agrarian nostalgia and rural simplicity as America became more urbanized, eventually becoming the beloved cultural icon it is today.</p>

The analysis, conducted by a researcher who was part of the 2022 expedition that found the wreck, argues the ship had several structural weaknesses that made it unsuitable for the compressive forces of dense pack ice. The study cites design flaws, such as a long machine room and a lack of diagonal support beams, and even a letter from Shackleton himself expressing that the ship was not as robust as his previous vessel, the Nimrod.</p>

          <p>Travel during China's eight-day "Golden Week" national holiday is projected to reach a record high of over 2.4 billion trips, according to the Ministry of Transport. This figure represents a 6.2% increase compared to last year's holiday period. To accommodate the surge in travelers, the national railway operator has added nearly 1,900 extra trains, with more to be deployed as needed on popular routes. While tickets are selling quickly for high-demand lines like Shenzhen-Guangzhou and Shanghai-Beijing, some availability remains for the massive annual migration of tourists and families.</p>

          <p>Australia's cricket team is facing uncertainty over the fitness of captain Pat Cummins for the upcoming Ashes series, with reports suggesting a back stress issue has not fully healed. While no official decision has been made, the fast bowler's status for the first Test is in doubt. Cummins has a history of back injuries that have caused him to miss significant periods of play in the past. If he is ruled out, Scott Boland would likely join the pace attack and Steve Smith would take over as captain, a major blow to Australia's hopes of retaining the urn.</p>

          <p>The skull-and-straw-hat flag from the popular Japanese manga series "One Piece" has been adopted by youth-led protest movements around the world. The symbol, representing the series' freedom-seeking Straw Hat Pirates, first gained prominence in Indonesia as an expression of discontent with the government and has since appeared in large-scale demonstrations in Nepal, Madagascar, and other nations. The flag resonates with Gen Z protesters who connect with the series' themes of challenging corrupt authority and fighting for individual choice. It joins other pop culture icons, like the Guy Fawkes mask, in becoming a powerful, unifying symbol of modern resistance.</p>

          <p>Japan's SoftBank Group has agreed to purchase the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion. The acquisition is a key move in SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's strategy to position the company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom, particularly in the realm of "Physical AI." The deal will integrate ABB's robotics technology with SoftBank's vision of creating Artificial Super Intelligence that is vastly more powerful than human intellect. For ABB, the sale provides immediate value to shareholders and replaces its previous plan to spin off the robotics unit as a separate company.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of consumers affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal, with average payouts estimated at £700 per agreement. The scheme addresses unfair commission arrangements, undisclosed fees, and inaccurate information provided to buyers for 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024, with total lender payouts potentially reaching £8.2 billion. While the FCA aims to provide fair compensation, the proposed amount is lower than some previous estimates, and industry representatives have argued that the regulator is overcompensating for the losses incurred.

          <p>American golfer Collin Morikawa has acknowledged that some U.S. fans at last month's Ryder Cup in New York "probably crossed the line" with their verbal abuse directed at the European team.

Morikawa, who had previously encouraged fans to create "chaos," clarified that he never intended for them to be rude. The incidents have reignited the debate over appropriate fan behavior at the highly charged international golf tournament, which Europe ultimately won.</p>

Air traffic controllers are required to work without pay during the shutdown, leading to a reported increase in sick leave.

          <p>Turkey is strategically shifting its energy supply, which could significantly reduce its reliance on natural gas from Russia and Iran. By increasing domestic production and boosting liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from the U.S., Turkey aims to meet over half of its gas needs from these sources by 2028. This diversification strengthens Turkey's energy security and supports its goal of becoming a regional gas hub. With several long-term pipeline contracts with Russia and Iran nearing expiration, Ankara is positioned to negotiate more flexible terms and smaller volumes, shrinking a key European market for Moscow and Tehran.

          <p>Everton's Jordan Pickford has firmly established himself as England's undisputed number one goalkeeper, silencing earlier debates about his position with consistent performances. His strengths include rapid reflexes, exceptional long-range distribution for starting counter-attacks, and a proven ability to perform in high-pressure tournament situations and penalty shootouts. While his animated on-pitch demeanor was once seen as a weakness, he has matured and reduced errors, keeping clean sheets in half of his international appearances. With no clear challenger for his spot, Pickford's experience and reliability have made him a cornerstone of the national team.</p>
