          <p>Following a collision with a Mexican navy ship, officials inspected the Brooklyn Bridge and found no significant structural damage to its load-bearing elements. The New York City Department of Transportation confirmed this finding on X, while the NTSB corroborated the lack of structural damage. The NTSB is investigating the incident, including weather conditions, the ship's operations, and potential recording devices on board, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days. The investigation will involve interviews with crew members, tugboat operators, and a review of surveillance footage to determine the cause of the collision. The ship was en route to sail south down the East River and head for sea when the incident occured.</p>

          <p>After former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, this article provides an overview of the disease. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men, often detected through screening tests like PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams. Treatment options vary depending on the stage and spread of the cancer, ranging from observation and surgery to radiation and hormone therapy. While metastatic prostate cancer is not curable, advancements in medical management have significantly improved survival rates over the past three decades. The article includes information on signs and symptoms, screening methods, treatment options, and survival rates associated with prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is reviewing a controversial plea deal offered to L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of using excessive force against an unarmed woman. The plea deal, proposed by newly appointed U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, would reduce Kirk's felony conviction to a misdemeanor and spare him prison time, a move that has led to turmoil within the U.S. Attorney's office, including resignations. The incident involved Kirk throwing a woman to the ground and pepper-spraying her while she filmed him during a 2023 arrest. The judge is scrutinizing the government's justification for the deal, while the victim and her attorney are protesting the leniency of the proposed sentence.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is experiencing volatility due to the ebb and flow of tariff shifts and ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Despite a 9.5% increase in container units moved in April, driven by importers rushing to get cargo in before tariffs took effect, the port's executive director, Gene Seroka, noted that this boost reflects uncertainty rather than positive growth. The port, which relies on China for nearly 45% of its business, is feeling the impact of President Trump‚Äôs erratic trade policies, indicating a tariff-tinged shipping panic. While imports increased by 5%, exports fell by 3% year-on-year, highlighting the unbalanced trade situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have climbed back above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to concerns about rising government debt. This is the first time since April 11 that the average 30-year mortgage rate has surpassed this threshold, though it eased slightly later in the day. Despite Federal Reserve interest rate cuts last year, mortgage rates remain high, tracking the 10-year Treasury bond, which is sensitive to economic conditions. Elevated rates, combined with a shortage of affordable properties, continue to challenge aspiring homebuyers, with only a fraction of listed homes being affordable for households with a $75,000 annual income.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.‚Äôs announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has shifted the political narrative, prompting an outpouring of sympathy but also raising questions about his health and past decisions. While Democrats express concern and support, some speculate about the timing of the announcement and whether Biden knew about his condition during his presidency. The news has temporarily paused discussions about Biden's role in the party's 2024 defeat, although some, like former Representative Dean Phillips, suggest the diagnosis was strategically timed. The announcement has reignited debates about Biden's fitness for office and the transparency surrounding his health during his time in the White House.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The decision declares the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as "null and void" and orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the administration's actions, including terminating board members and dispersing assets, were unconstitutional. She emphasized that USIP supports both the Executive and Legislative branches as an independent think tank and that the President's removal power does not extend outside the Executive branch. The ruling allows USIP to resume its work in promoting peace and stability around the world.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are facing internal divisions as they attempt to pass President Trump's tax bill, with disagreements arising between House and Senate GOP members, moderates and hard-liners, and Republicans and economic reality. The bill is projected to increase the deficit, but Republican leaders deny this, relying on optimistic economic projections. Moody‚Äôs downgraded the nation‚Äôs credit rating, citing increased federal spending without corresponding revenue. Despite these challenges, the Budget Committee advanced the bill after negotiations, though structural contradictions remain, including extending tax cuts without raising other taxes or making significant spending cuts.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring major U.S. companies like Walmart and Mattel to absorb the costs of his tariffs rather than pass them on to consumers. This comes as companies report financial strain from the ongoing trade war, which has imposed tariffs on various nations and products. While the White House insists foreign countries bear the brunt of the tariffs, economists argue that U.S. companies and consumers are most affected. The president's stance deviates from his earlier attacks on price gouging and reflects a broader effort to control how companies respond to his trade policies.</p>

          <p>China's control over the global supply of critical minerals, essential for manufacturing high-tech products, has become a significant point of leverage in its trade war with the United States. Recent cases of antimony and bismuth smuggling highlight the pressure on manufacturers as China restricts exports of these minerals. The US relies heavily on China for rare earth imports, and Beijing has increasingly used export restrictions as retaliation against US tariffs. This control could potentially cripple advanced manufacturing in the US, as materials are necessary to make everything from smartphones to fighter jets.</p>

          <p>A luxury Boeing 747 gifted to the U.S. government by Qatar is currently in San Antonio, Texas, awaiting a specialized overhaul to become the next Air Force One. The offer of the $400 million plane came as President Trump was leaving for a trip to the Middle East, during which Qatar announced plans to invest over $1 trillion in business deals with the United States. Experts suggest retrofitting the plane to meet presidential security standards could take years, potentially creating security risks if rushed. Some members of Congress have expressed concerns about using a foreign-made plane for presidential transport.</p>

The article ranks the performances, highlighting New Order for their flawless set and Joy Division tribute, Devo for their wacky and whimsical show, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds for their gospel-like performance. Other notable performances included Garbage, OMD, and Alison Moyet. The Go-Go's performance, however, was described as uncoordinated with sound issues, while Death Cult's set was deemed odd due to confusion over the band's identity and a lack of crowd engagement.</p>

The UN maintains Israel is obligated to ensure food and medical supplies reach Gaza's population.
