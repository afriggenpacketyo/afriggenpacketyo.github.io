          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a decline as investors reacted to Warren Buffett's announcement that Greg Abel will succeed him as CEO on January 1, 2026; Buffett will remain as chairman. The transition marks the end of an era for the conglomerate, which Buffett transformed from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion juggernaut. Macrae Sykes from Gabelli Funds believes shareholders should welcome the transparent transition, expressing confidence that Buffett will continue to mentor Abel. The announcement came as Berkshire shares reached a record high, highlighting the company's continued success under Buffett's leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has scaled back its policy on recovering overpayments, reducing the clawback rate from 100% to 50% of a beneficiary's monthly check. This change follows concerns that the initial 100% clawback policy, implemented in March under Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek's direction, was causing financial hardship for many recipients. The SSA's inspector general found that numerous overpayments were due to the agency's calculation errors, not the beneficiaries' fault. While the reduction to 50% is a step in the right direction, advocacy groups argue it will still pose a significant burden for disabled workers who rely heavily on SSDI benefits.</p>

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized the company's commitment to its mission and downplayed the dispute with Musk.

          <p>A new assessment by the European Central Bank indicates that European consumers are increasingly avoiding U.S. products and services due to trade tensions and tariffs imposed by President Trump. This shift appears to be a long-term structural change in consumer preferences, with Europeans actively seeking alternatives to American brands, even if they are more expensive. Grass-roots boycotts of American products have gained traction, with consumers using apps and online groups to identify and avoid U.S. goods. Major companies like Tesla and McDonald's are also observing this growing anti-American sentiment.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, attributing this to his economic policies and urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, current data from AAA and GasBuddy indicates that the national average is significantly higher, around $3.12 to $3.165 per gallon. Trump's figure likely references RBOB gasoline futures, which track wholesale, unfinished gasoline prices and do not reflect the final cost to consumers. Analysts emphasize that RBOB prices exclude taxes, transportation costs, and other fees that contribute to the price at the pump.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging, investing in gold bars and coins presents both opportunities and challenges for investors. The rising price of gold could lead to quick profits, but also makes entry more expensive. Easy access to gold bars and coins is a pro, with various online and in-person options available. However, storage costs and insurance need to be considered. Investors should limit gold to no more than 10% of their overall portfolio to avoid crowding out other income-producing assets (not investment advice).</p>
