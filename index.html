          <h2>Declassified Memo Undermines Trump's Rationale for Deporting Venezuelans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang. This claim was used to justify invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's activities in the United States. The release of the memo further weakens the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act, a law previously used only during declared wars, and raises questions about the Justice Department's investigation into media coverage of the issue.

          <p>President Trump is leveraging his meme coin, $TRUMP, into a lucrative venture, generating over $320 million in fees for its creators through trading activities. The Trump family is using the meme coin to offer access to the president, with top holders invited to a dinner and reception at Trump's golf club. Trading activity in the meme coin surged after the dinner announcement, increasing its value. Critics argue that the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency could allow bad actors to unduly influence the president through purchasing his digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

He ordered the State Board of Elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by 734 votes over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin.

          <p>Utah is struggling to save the Great Salt Lake from drying up, a crisis that could lead to environmental and economic disaster. Despite state lawmakers investing $1 billion in water conservation, critics argue that the efforts are insufficient and slow-paced. The lake's decline, primarily caused by human water consumption, threatens public health, the ecosystem, and industries reliant on the lake's resources. A recent year of heavy snow has temporarily stabilized the lake, but drastic measures, including significant water consumption cuts, are needed to restore it to a healthy level.</p>

          <p>Former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is testing the limits of New York City campaign finance rules by allegedly using his campaign website to instruct a super PAC, Fix the City, on how to support his mayoral bid, a practice known as red-boxing. This involves posting strategic information in a public location where big money groups can access it, circumventing rules that prohibit direct communication between campaigns and super PACs. If found in violation, Cuomo could face penalties and lose millions in public matching funds. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has issued a warning about the new rules, but it remains unclear if they are scrutinizing Cuomo‚Äôs tactics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit that seeks to sharply restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, taking the same position as the Biden administration. The court filing makes no mention of the merits of the case, but argues that the case does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the federal district court in which it was filed. This decision may reflect a desire to be politically cautious on abortion, possibly until the 2026 midterm elections, as abortion rights have prevailed in recent elections.</p>

With the failure of cease-fire talks and Netanyahu warning of an ‚Äúintensive‚Äù Israeli escalation, there is concern that a major offensive could jeopardize peace efforts. Trump's focus has shifted to other issues, such as diplomacy with Iran, and his administration has been less involved in managing Israel's Gaza campaign compared to the previous administration.</p>

          <p>India is concerned about Chinese 'dumping' of goods, particularly viscose yarn, as trade tensions with the Trump administration escalate. With the US imposing high tariffs on Chinese goods, Chinese producers are seeking alternative markets, flooding Indian ports with cheaper imports. This is causing distress among Indian textile makers, who struggle to compete with the lower prices. India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, and has imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports.</p>
