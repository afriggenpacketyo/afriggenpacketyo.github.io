          <p>Elon Musk announced he would significantly reduce his involvement in Donald Trump's administration, specifically his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), following a substantial drop in Tesla's profits and revenue. The company attributed the financial downturn to decreased sales and backlash from Musk's political activities, including contributing heavily to Trump's re-election campaign. Musk's reduced government involvement is expected to free up his time to focus on Tesla's challenges, including navigating trade policy and changing political sentiment that has impacted demand.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index rising by 0.9% year-on-year, as the country prepares for a general election. While food and private transport costs contributed to inflation, core inflation slowed down, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore to ease monetary policy for the second time this year. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledged cost-of-living pressures as a real concern, attributing them to global factors such as wars and supply chain disruptions. The government has also downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025, citing declines in manufacturing and some service sectors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing him for not cutting interest rates aggressively enough. Trump added that he would like Powell to be "a little more active" in lowering rates, expressing optimism about improving trade relations with China. This announcement comes after speculation that Trump was considering firing Powell, a move that would have significant implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve. Trump also indicated that tariffs would fall if a trade deal with China is reached, but not to zero.</p>

          <p>Diplomats from the UK, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the US are convening in London for fresh talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. The discussions occur amid speculation that Russia may be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in exchange for concessions. While the pace of diplomatic efforts is increasing, uncertainty remains about the direction and potential success of the negotiations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out recognizing Crimea as Russian territory.</p>

          <p>Major policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are joining forces to lobby against the Trump administration's proposed 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups argue that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many suppliers are already facing financial distress. The joint letter, addressed to key administration officials, emphasizes the potential for production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies within the industry. Auto executives anticipate a drop in vehicle sales and increased costs across the industry if the tariffs are implemented.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Chicago Cubs in extra innings after squandering a late-game lead, highlighting ongoing challenges for the team this season. Despite scoring a season-high in runs, the Dodgers struggled with situational hitting and bullpen issues, ultimately failing to secure the win. Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth inning, and the Dodgers couldn't capitalize in the 10th, leading to a walk-off single by Ian Happ. The loss underscores the need for the team to improve its consistency and execution.</p>

          <p>Recent signs of the White House softening its stance on tariffs against China may not indicate progress in trade talks but could provide Beijing with an advantage, according to economists. President Trump's comments about reducing tariffs on Chinese goods have been interpreted as a sign of anxiety from the U.S. side. Experts suggest that China is not showing the same level of urgency, potentially allowing them to negotiate a more favorable deal.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has unveiled a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year.

While the US only supplied a small portion of China's LNG imports in the past, contracted volumes were expected to grow significantly in the coming years.
