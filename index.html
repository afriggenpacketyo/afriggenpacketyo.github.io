            <p>Lakers legend Magic Johnson criticized the team's performance in their Game 1 loss to the Timberwolves, calling it one of their worst this season. Johnson noted the team lacked energy and played as if it were a regular season game, also singling out coach JJ Redick for failing to make necessary adjustments. The Timberwolves dominated offensively, shooting over 50% from the field and beyond the arc, while the Lakers struggled to find their rhythm. James acknowledged the Timberwolves' physicality, emphasizing the need to control what they can in future games.</p>

Verstappen finished second, followed by Charles Leclerc who drove an outstanding first stint.

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders," stating troops believed they faced a threat from enemy forces. The inquiry found that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim for which the IDF did not provide evidence. The deputy commander of the unit involved was dismissed for providing an incomplete report, and the IDF confirmed they are holding a PRCS medic detained after the incident. The incident occurred in a hostile combat zone with poor visibility, and the commander perceived an immediate threat from approaching vehicles.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee warned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a summer drop-off in economic activity after an "artificially high" start. Businesses are stocking up on inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of the tariffs, which could inflate economic activity in April but lead to a slowdown in the coming months. Goolsbee expressed optimism about the country's longer-term economic outlook but noted uncertainty surrounding the size and scope of the tariffs after the 90-day pause expires in July.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, after visiting Kilmar Ábrego García in El Salvador, emphasized that his trip was to support Ábrego García’s right to due process. Van Hollen argued that denying due process to one person threatens the constitutional rights of everyone in the US. He accused the Trump administration of lying about the case and the Salvadoran government of staging photos to deceive people. Despite claims of MS-13 membership, the government has presented no evidence in federal court.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's immigration policy prioritizes attracting wealthy individuals, reflecting a crass approach to national belonging. While most people dislike the idea of treating citizenship as a commodity, many countries offer residency in exchange for investment or donation. Trump's focus aligns with free marketeers who see the current "golden-visa" scheme as cumbersome, under-priced, and inefficient. This perspective treats national belonging as a commodity, valuing lucre over other considerations.</p>
