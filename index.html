            <h2>Myanmar Earthquake May Impact China's Rare Earth Mineral Supply</h2>

            <p>Analysts suggest that the recent earthquake in Myanmar could disrupt the supply of rare earth minerals to China, potentially increasing price volatility. Myanmar is a key supplier of these minerals, especially dysprosium and terbium, which are essential for high-temperature magnets used in various technologies. The earthquake may have damaged mining equipment, affected safety, and blocked transport routes. China relies heavily on Myanmar for these imports, making it vulnerable to supply disruptions, and this event could force China to diversify its sources. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A cable car crash near Naples, Italy, resulted in the deaths of four people after a cabin plunged to the ground. The victims included three passengers and the driver, while another person sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to a hospital. Initial reports suggest a snapped cable may have caused the accident, with investigations underway. The incident occurred on Mount Faito, and rescue efforts were hampered by poor weather conditions. The Mount Faito cable car has been operating since 1952, with a similar deadly accident occurring in 1960.</p>

            <p>Director James Cameron, known for films like "The Terminator," has shifted his perspective on AI, now viewing it as a tool to reduce VFX costs and accelerate film production. He joined Stability AI's board to understand AI development and integrate it into VFX workflows. Cameron believes AI can automate tedious tasks like rotoscoping, allowing artists to focus on more creative aspects. While acknowledging copyright concerns, he suggests focusing on the output of AI rather than restricting its input, comparing AI learning to the human brain's process of creating models.</p>

            <p>A federal judge blocked the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive Social Security records, citing concerns about privacy. The judge noted that granting DOGE unlimited access to personally identifiable information would betray the government's commitment to citizens' privacy. The order restricts DOGE members from accessing records containing personal information and installing software on SSA computer systems. This ruling follows previous concerns about DOGE's influence on the Social Security Administration.</p>
