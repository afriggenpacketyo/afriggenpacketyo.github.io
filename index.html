        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minnesota State Senator Nicole Mitchell was convicted of first-degree burglary for breaking into her stepmother's home. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor party member claimed she was retrieving her late father's belongings, including his ashes, out of concern for her stepmother, who she said has Alzheimer's. However, a jury found her guilty after a trial that featured bodycam footage of her arrest where she admitted she was "not good at this." Following the verdict, she is expected to resign from her position and faces a potential sentence ranging from six months to 20 years in jail.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Introduce New Law Targeting Mass Attack Plotters</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 20:07:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced plans for a new law to prosecute individuals who plan mass casualty events, even if they lack a specific ideological motive. The legislation aims to close a legal gap highlighted by incidents like the Southport attack, where plotters could not be charged with serious offenses comparable to terrorism preparation. This new power will allow police to intervene and apprehend violence-obsessed individuals earlier, treating the planning of such attacks with the same gravity as terrorism. The move is part of a broader effort to adapt the justice system to evolving threats, including those from individuals radicalized online.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar shortstop Mookie Betts an unplanned day off, citing the need for a mental and mechanical reset. Betts has been struggling through one of the worst offensive seasons of his career, with his batting average and OPS falling to career-low levels. Roberts made the decision to take the pressure off Betts, hoping that observing a game from the dugout could provide a beneficial change in perspective. While Betts wanted to play, the manager insisted on the break, highlighting the urgency of addressing the slump for the team's success.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old man, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta after he was crushed to death by a bulldozer clearing a homeless encampment. The lawsuit alleges that city employees failed to check if anyone was inside the tents before flattening them in preparation for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Taylor's death has sparked outrage among advocates, who criticize the city's approach to homelessness amid an affordable housing crisis. The family's lawyers are seeking unspecified damages and calling for the city to treat its unhoused population with dignity and respect.</p>

Huckabee, typically a staunch supporter of Israel, called the desecration an "act of terror" and insisted that the perpetrators must be found and prosecuted.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against the Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch.

The lawsuit accuses the newspaper of "clear journalistic failures" and making false and defamatory claims.

          <p>There is growing concern in the UK about the increasing use of nicotine pouches, also known as white snus, among young people, with some using products containing up to 150mg of nicotine. These discreet pouches are sold without age restrictions and are reportedly causing significant gum damage, with some users experiencing shredded gums and lesions. Health professionals and Trading Standards officers are frustrated by the lack of regulation, which allows children to purchase these highly addictive products. A proposed government bill aims to make it illegal to sell the pouches to individuals under 18.</p>

          <p>Drivers at Edinburgh Airport are increasingly waiting in nearby lay-bys and side roads to avoid the "kiss-and-fly" charges at the official drop-off zone, which can cost £6 for a ten-minute stay. This behavior is a response to rising fees at many UK airports, which stand in contrast to most major EU airports that offer free drop-offs. The article highlights the frustration of drivers who feel the charges are extortionate, forcing them to use inconvenient workarounds. While the airport offers a free drop-off zone further away, it is less practical for many, especially those with mobility issues.</p>

          <p>In Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, a systematic campaign is underway to erase Ukrainian national identity and instill pro-Russian ideology in children from a young age. This involves militaristic youth groups like Yunarmia, a Russian-centric school curriculum that justifies the invasion, and "bravery lessons" from Russian soldiers. The campaign also includes taking thousands of Ukrainian children on tours of Russia or forcibly deporting them to "re-education camps," actions that violate international humanitarian law.

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week school summer holiday and redistribute the time off throughout the year. Proponents argue it could help prevent learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for working families, and potentially lower holiday prices. However, the idea faces opposition, particularly from teachers who value the long break for rest and preparation, and some fear it could concentrate travel demand into a smaller window. While some local authorities are already adopting shorter summer breaks, a national consensus remains elusive.</p>

Local indigenous communities report that wetlands are drying up, flamingo populations are shrinking, and their traditional way of life is threatened.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a cultural shift to encourage more people, particularly women, to invest in stocks and shares rather than keeping money in low-interest cash savings accounts. The government plans to send information about investment opportunities to savers and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize the move. Experts note that the financial industry has often failed to appeal to women and that a push towards investing must be accompanied by better education and a careful approach to avoid deterring newcomers, especially in volatile markets.

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been removed from his position at the Pentagon. Fulcher initially joined the Defense Department as part of a government efficiency team and was later promoted to his advisory role. His departure is part of a significant staffing shakeup in Hegseth's office that followed a scandal involving the leak of sensitive military plans on the Signal messaging app earlier this year. The Pentagon confirmed Fulcher's departure, and he released a statement saying his planned six months of service were complete and expressing gratitude for the opportunity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate the partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions that forced airlines to relocate flights from Mexico City's main airport to a newer, more distant one, which the U.S. claims violates a bilateral aviation agreement. Under the new rules, all Mexican airlines must seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The dispute could impact the more than 40 million passengers who flew between the two countries last year and jeopardizes a major airline alliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after her 17-year-old brother Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a mistaken-identity killing, Nishat Siddiqi has made a public appeal to the fugitive suspected of ordering the attack. Mohammed Ali Ege, one of Europe's most wanted men, fled the UK after the 2010 murder and later escaped custody in India. In a podcast, Nishat urged Ege to hand himself in, telling him he is "not truly free" while living a life on the run. Aamir was stabbed to death at his Cardiff home by two contract killers who went to the wrong address.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy electrified the home crowd at Royal Portrush during the third round of The Open, shooting a 66 to move to eight under par. His round was a roller coaster of emotions, featuring an incredible 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole that generated one of the loudest roars of his career. Despite the strong performance, which included a bizarre moment when his club unearthed a buried golf ball in the rough, he remains six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler. McIlroy acknowledged the challenge ahead but felt he had given himself at least a "half-chance" for a miracle on the final day.</p>

Israel has intervened in support of the Druze, conducting strikes on Syrian government targets.

Scheffler posted a solid third-round 67 to reach 14 under par, demonstrating the relentless consistency that has defined his recent dominance in golf. Despite a brief challenge from Matt Fitzpatrick, Scheffler's unflappable play, including crucial par saves on the back nine, has created an air of inevitability around his pursuit of a fourth major title.

          <p>Germany is deepening its security and defense cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new "E3" alliance. This pivot comes amid concerns over the reliability of the United States as a security partner, particularly under a potential Trump presidency. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, following similar high-level engagements with France. The E3's focus is on creating a more independent European defense posture, with the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK seen as a potential supplement to the US security guarantee.

This article highlights cases where men with documented psychiatric disorders were deemed fit for service, sometimes due to incomplete medical records or a cursory examination process. Commanders and human rights advocates point to a systemic issue where unfit individuals are drafted and become a burden on units.

          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to signing Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, initially on a loan with an option to buy. Rashford has been an outcast at Old Trafford since a falling out with manager Ruben Amorim late last year and was told to train separately from the first team. For Barcelona, the move is a way to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets, and the loan structure is financially advantageous for the club. The potential transfer raises questions, as Rashford's form has been inconsistent, but Barcelona is betting on the 27-year-old's potential to be a major asset.</p>
