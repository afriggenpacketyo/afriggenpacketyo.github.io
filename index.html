          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, but revenue fell short of projections, leading to a 5% stock drop. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $11.53 billion, below the expected $11.62 billion, while earnings per share were 83 cents against the expected 50 cents. Gross bookings are expected to reach between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion in the current quarter. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed the FTC lawsuit regarding Uber One's billing practices, and highlighted the company's advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, reaching an annual run-rate of 1.5 million AV trips.</p>

          <p>Pandora CEO Alexander Lacik has cautioned that proposed U.S. tariff hikes could lead to significant price increases across the affordable jewelry sector. While the current 10% tariffs are manageable, a return to previously announced higher rates would impact jewelry manufacturers importing from Asia. Pandora, heavily reliant on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, could face a potential hit to group revenues if tariffs remain in place.

          <p>President Trump's strategy of proposing extreme tariffs and then scaling them back has normalized significant tariffs, according to a New York Times analysis. While a 10 percent tariff was once unthinkable, it now seems manageable compared to the threatened 60 percent. This tactic, known as anchoring, has reset expectations, even though tariffs still represent a tax increase for consumers. Despite some companies adapting, tariffs of 10 to 25 percent can still erase profit margins and stall growth, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warning about the impact on small businesses.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians are largely dismissive of Russia's proposed three-day ceasefire, viewing it as a propaganda move rather than a genuine effort to de-escalate the conflict. President Zelensky has rejected the offer, while residents express distrust based on past experiences of broken truces. The proposal contrasts with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and negotiations, which Ukraine accepted but Russia rejected. Despite the skepticism, some Ukrainians express a longing for even a brief respite from the ongoing violence.</p>

          <p>Despite lingering economic uncertainty, weekly mortgage demand surged by 11%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, as interest rates dropped slightly for the second consecutive week.

Applications to refinance also rose, driven by Veterans Affairs loans. The Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting could influence mortgage rates further.</p>
