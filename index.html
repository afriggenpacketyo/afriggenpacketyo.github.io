          <h2>Japanese Prime Minister's Cabinet Approval Rating Plummets to Record Low</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 06:36:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet's approval rating has hit a record low of 27.4%, a significant drop from the previous month. This decline is attributed to growing dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising prices and the dismissal of consumption tax cuts as a solution. The survey indicates that a large majority of respondents feel that consumption taxes should be reduced or abolished to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis, highlighting the challenges Ishiba faces in addressing economic concerns and maintaining public support ahead of upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes how India's ongoing conflict with Pakistan, particularly the recent military escalation, undermines its aspirations as a diplomatic and economic power. Despite India's military capabilities, the persistent conflict equates it with Pakistan, hindering its international standing. The article highlights the historical roots of the conflict and the challenges in finding a resolution, especially with the rise of religious nationalism in both countries. India's focus on countering terrorism from Pakistan diverts resources from strategic priorities like competing with China, perpetuating a cycle of conflict that limits its global influence.</p>

          <p>A UK government minister confirms that negotiations are underway to secure a deal allowing British passport holders to use EU e-gates at European airports. This initiative aims to reduce border queues and improve travel efficiency for UK citizens post-Brexit. However, concerns have been raised by Conservative MP Alex Burghart regarding potential compromises on UK sovereignty and regulatory alignment with the EU. The European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds also indicated efforts to reduce red tape to lower food prices, emphasizing that discussions are in the final stages.</p>

          <p>After a five-year pause, the U.S. Department of Education is set to resume wage garnishment for defaulted student loan borrowers, potentially affecting millions of Americans. This decision follows the Trump administration's announcement to seize tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits, reversing the Biden administration's relief measures. With over 5 million borrowers currently in default, many fear the financial strain of having up to 15% of their income withheld, especially amidst rising living costs. Some borrowers report difficulties in getting current on their loans due to staffing shortages at the Education Department.</p>

          <p>Portugal is holding its third parliamentary election in three years after the previous government collapsed due to a failed confidence vote. The election is dominated by issues such as housing and immigration, reflecting a decade of political instability and fragile governments. Opinion polls suggest that Prime Minister Luis Montenegro's Democratic Alliance is likely to win the most votes but may still fall short of a parliamentary majority. The far-right Chega party is also gaining ground, driven by demands for stricter immigration policies, while the country grapples with a housing crisis and rising costs of living.</p>

Despite television footage and live timing data suggesting Bearman crossed the line before the red flag, the FIA maintains its original decision, citing the presence of orange 'abort lap' lights on the start-line gantry.</p>

Consumer advocates argue that the structure of executive compensation, heavily weighted towards profit and stock price appreciation, undermines the incentive to prioritize safety.

          <p>With its climate progress under assault from the federal government, California is employing a multipronged defense strategy, including litigation and legislation. The state is challenging federal actions that undermine its environmental policies, such as attempts to block its clean air waivers and halt its cap-and-trade program. California is also leveraging its legislative strength to enact laws that promote climate action, such as requiring corporations to disclose carbon emissions. These efforts aim to protect the state's climate goals and serve as a model for other states.</p>

Films like Ari Aster's "Eddington" and Dominik Moll's "Dossier 137" explore characters grappling with moral and political storms, often leading to despair. While some films, like Oliver Laxe's "Sirât," offer moments of dark humor, the overall tone suggests a cynicism about the possibility of positive change. However, Harris Dickinson's directorial debut, "Urchin," provides a glimmer of hope amidst its gritty portrayal of addiction and survival.</p>
