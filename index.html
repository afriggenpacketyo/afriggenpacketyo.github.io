            <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is anticipated to lower interest rates for the third time this year due to worries about the Eurozone's economic growth, influenced by global tariff tensions. Markets predict a high probability of a quarter-point rate cut, which would decrease the ECB's deposit facility rate to 2.25%. While previous language from the ECB suggested a potential pause in monetary easing, recent tariff policies have reignited concerns about economic growth, compelling the ECB to consider further rate cuts to stimulate the economy.

            <p>The Texas Legislature has passed Senate Bill 14, which aims to establish a new Texas Regulatory Office, called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), within the governor’s office. Inspired by Elon Musk’s DOGE, the bill seeks to streamline state regulations and eliminate unnecessary rules to save taxpayers money and boost the Texas economy. The bill also requires agencies to write rules in plain language, reduce paperwork and fees, and justify new rules with clear cost and benefit analyses. S.B. 14 is now headed to Governor Greg Abbott's desk for signing into law.</p>

Greene addressed the disruptions, accusing the media of defending an illegal alien and reaffirming her support for law enforcement.

            <p>The UK inflation rate has decreased for the second consecutive month, reaching 2.6% in March, a significant drop from the 11% peak in 2022. The decline is attributed to falling petrol and toy prices, while food prices remained stable. However, analysts predict a rise in inflation starting in April due to increased household bills, including utilities and council tax, as well as the impact of US tariffs on imported goods, creating uncertainty in the economic outlook.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with demands from the Trump administration, which included directives on governance, hiring, and teaching, leading to a freeze of $2.2 billion in federal funds. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, asserted that no government should dictate what private universities can teach. Despite potential financial consequences, Harvard's decision has garnered support from students, alumni, and former President Barack Obama, who praised the university's stance.

            <p>Global health officials are concerned about a potential resurgence of polio due to increasing cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan, coupled with disruptions in vaccination campaigns and cuts in USAID contracts. Pakistan reported 74 cases in 2024, while Afghanistan saw 24, with new cases linked to vaccine campaign interruptions. The dismantling of USAID is projected to potentially lead to an additional 200,000 cases of polio causing paralysis each year. Challenges in both countries include vaccine distrust, security risks, and difficulties in reaching all children with the necessary doses.</p>

            <p>A former Gambian soldier, Michael Sang Correa, has been convicted on torture charges by a U.S. court for crimes committed under Yahya Jammeh's rule. Correa was found guilty of conspiring to torture suspected opponents as part of the "Junglers" military unit. The trial, held in Denver, Colorado, was conducted under a rarely used law that prosecutes crimes committed outside the U.S. Correa faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each torture count and the conspiracy charge.</p>

            <p>The UK Supreme Court has ruled that doctors involved in two end-of-life cases can be named, following disputes over life support treatment for two children. The parents of the deceased children sought to "tell their story," leading to a challenge of court orders that barred doctors from being publicly named. The Supreme Court emphasized that restrictions on freedom of speech must be convincingly established, which the NHS trusts in the case failed to do.</p>

            <p>Tommy Robinson, the far-right anti-Islam activist, has lost an appeal against his 18-month prison sentence for contempt of court. The 42-year-old was jailed last October for ignoring a court order not to repeat lies about a Syrian refugee, who had successfully sued him for libel. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, stating that the judge's application of the law and reasoning on the appropriate sanction exhibited a meticulous approach.</p>

            <p>A system malfunction caused the wrong anthem to be played before Aston Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris St-Germain. The Europa League anthem was played over the PA system before being switched to the correct Champions League anthem. Club and Uefa sources say the automated system responsible for playing the anthem crashed and was overridden by another system. Despite the error, Villa recovered from 2-0 down to win the second leg 3-2, but PSG progressed 5-4 on aggregate.</p>
