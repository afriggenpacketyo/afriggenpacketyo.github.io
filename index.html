          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:59:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military carried out another boat strike in the Caribbean Sea, marking the sixth such attack since last month, but this time with survivors rescued by a Navy helicopter. President Trump stated the strike targeted a drug-carrying submarine, justifying the attacks as part of a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels. Some lawmakers have questioned the administration's authority to attack drug cartels without congressional approval, especially amidst a broader military buildup in the Caribbean aimed at pressuring the Venezuelan government. Trump also confirmed covert CIA action in Venezuela and mentioned that Venezuelan officials offered the U.S. stakes in their natural resources to end U.S. actions. The focus is on maritime interdiction in the Caribbean. Optimism is somewhat tempered due to the violence. The article focuses on military action and political tensions. </p>

          <p>Credo, a semiconductor company, is experiencing rapid growth due to its purple active electrical cables (AECs) used in AI data centers, as highlighted by Elon Musk's xAI data center. The company's shares have more than doubled this year, driven by increasing deployments from major companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and xAI. Credo's AECs, costing between $300 and $500 each, offer a more reliable alternative to fiber optic cables, reducing the risk of data center downtime. CEO Bill Brennan notes the increasing demand from hyperscalers in the early stages of planning large AI clusters, however, analysts caution that any pullback from major cloud providers could hurt suppliers like Credo. The article highlights the growth of a key player in the AI infrastructure market. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has offered the U.S. a significant stake in Venezuela's natural resources to de-escalate tensions. Trump made these comments while confirming he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, citing concerns over drugs and migration. The U.S. has recently conducted strikes on vessels suspected of drug trafficking off the Venezuelan coast, resulting in numerous deaths. The U.S. has been increasing pressure on Venezuela, with the Justice Department accusing Maduro of leading a drug cartel. Tensions remain high.

          <p>The Israeli military reported that the Red Cross received the body of a deceased hostage in the southern Gaza Strip, and the remains are being transferred to IDF troops for identification. This follows a statement from Hamas indicating their intention to hand over the body. Hamas has returned bodies of some deceased hostages and freed living hostages as part of a ceasefire agreement. Israel has expressed frustration that not all bodies have been returned, but the US has downplayed this as a breach of the agreement. The article details the exchange of hostages and the ongoing conflict. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency stay request with the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court order that blocked the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. The administration argues the injunction impedes the President's authority and endangers federal personnel and property. A three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals deemed the deployment a likely violation of the Tenth Amendment, asserting the administration is unlikely to prove a rebellion against the U.S. government. A temporary restraining order remains in effect, and a hearing is scheduled to determine whether to extend it. The article highlights a legal battle over federal versus state power. </p>

Maduro has accused Trump of seeking regime change, while the U.S. has justified the strikes by asserting an "armed conflict" with drug cartels.
