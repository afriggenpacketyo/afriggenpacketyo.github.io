        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volvo Cars has announced a $1.9 billion cost-cutting initiative due to a significant drop in operating profit during the first quarter of the year. The decline is attributed to reduced wholesale volumes, unfavorable currency exchange rates, and general automotive industry challenges. The company's "cost and cash action plan" will involve investment reductions and potential layoffs across its global operations, with further details to be disclosed later. Due to market uncertainty, Volvo Cars is withdrawing its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, focusing instead on managing controllable factors like cost reduction.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, experienced slower GDP growth and a decline in exports during the first quarter of the year, falling short of the national average. This underperformance is attributed to a high baseline from the previous year and unique pressures from the ongoing trade war and industrial transition. While the rest of China saw an export surge before US tariffs took effect, Shenzhen's exports declined, highlighting economic obstacles including high costs, insufficient orders, and subdued consumer prices. The city is now focusing on stimulating domestic demand to bolster its economy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering extending the sugar tax to include milk-based drinks like milkshakes and lattes, aiming to further reduce obesity. The proposal involves ending the exemption for milk-based drinks and reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the levy applies. While opponents argue the tax disproportionately affects lower-income families, supporters believe it will incentivize manufacturers to reduce sugar content. The consultation period will run until July, with the tax having raised £1.9 billion since its introduction in 2018.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal party has won Canada's federal election, with Carney vowing to "win this trade war" with the US. The election was heavily influenced by US President Donald Trump's threats of tariffs and calls to make Canada the 51st state. Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre conceded defeat, and the Liberals were able to regain lost popularity after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stepped down. Trump's statements about Canada becoming a US state played a significant role during the campaign.</p>

This would help avoid the proliferation of small pots and make it easier to manage pensions.
