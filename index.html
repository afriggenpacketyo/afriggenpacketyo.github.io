          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is expected to face trial in New York City on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, accused of running a criminal enterprise that manipulated women into commercial sex acts. The trial will include testimony from multiple accusers, including singer Cassie Ventura, his former girlfriend, and security video footage showing Combs attacking Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Combs has denied the allegations, though he has apologized for his behavior in the video. The trial is expected to last eight to ten weeks and will be closely followed by the media.</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly in discussions with Qatar to receive a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet, potentially for use as Air Force One. The plane, estimated to be worth $400 million, would be donated to Trump's presidential library after his term. This proposal has raised legal and ethical questions, with critics accusing Trump of potential ethics violations. The White House defends the negotiations, stating that any gift from a foreign government would be accepted in compliance with applicable laws and that the offer was for his use at no cost.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that he expects to meet with Chinese officials again in the coming weeks to continue trade negotiations following a 90-day pause on tariffs. This decision resulted from a meeting in Switzerland between Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese officials. The 90-day pause involves both countries lowering their baseline tariff rate by 115 percentage points to 10%, while the 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains. Bessent also noted a "very long and in-depth sidebar" regarding fentanyl, expressing optimism that China is serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, as both countries continue negotiations to resolve their trade differences. Under the agreement, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower import duties on American goods to 10% from 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that neither side wants a decoupling of their economies, and ongoing negotiations will involve key officials from both countries. While this agreement provides a temporary reprieve for businesses, economists warn that repercussions will linger, potentially leading to transport price increases as companies rush to schedule shipments during the negotiating window.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is planning to cut around 20,000 jobs globally, exceeding the previously announced reduction of 9,000, as the company faces deeper financial struggles.

          <p>An article explores the parallels between the 1926 disappearance and alleged kidnapping of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson and modern influencer scandals, such as that of Katie Sorensen, who falsely accused a Latino couple of attempted kidnapping. McPherson, like Sorensen, built a career on openness and accessibility, and her story, including blaming a Latino couple for her abduction, highlights themes of ambition, technology, and authenticity. The article draws on Claire Hoffman's biography of McPherson, "Sister, Sinner," to examine McPherson's life as a proto-influencer, noting her savvy use of media and her creation of a feminine brand of proselytizing.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to mutually lower extra tariffs on each other's imports by 115 percentage points, suspending additional duties for 90 days. The substantial tariff cuts, effective by Wednesday, followed ministerial talks in Geneva. Washington and Beijing also agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism. The United States will retain an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports as part of its "reciprocal" duties, along with a 20 percent levy over concerns about fentanyl. China will retain at least a 10 percent retaliatory tariff on all American goods.</p>

          <p>President Trump's upcoming trip to the Gulf region is primarily focused on securing business deals, including those involving planes, nuclear power, and arms. While past presidential visits to the Middle East have been driven by strategic visions, Trump's agenda centers on financial transactions that align with his expanding business plans. His family has pending deals with Saudi-owned firms, a cryptocurrency deal with a UAE affiliate, and a golf project backed by Qatar. The Qataris are also considering donating a luxury Boeing 747-8 plane to serve as Air Force One.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, has suggested that parents are to blame for their childrenâ€™s autism, and should research all aspects of their children's lives. Critics argue that these statements place undue blame on parents for a condition that is overwhelmingly genetic. Kennedy also told parents to "do their own research" on vaccines, despite scientific consensus showing no link between vaccines and autism. Experts warn that Kennedy's comments reinforce harmful ideals of intensive mothering and undermine public trust in established science.</p>

          <p>A contested North Carolina state supreme court race has revealed a potential strategy for candidates to challenge election results retroactively, according to observers. Despite Democrat Allison Riggs winning by 734 votes, Republican Jefferson Griffin sought to invalidate 65,000 votes. Although a federal judge ultimately halted the effort and ordered the race to be certified, the state court's initial support for disenfranchising voters sets a precedent for future challenges. Election law experts are divided on whether this will encourage similar attempts or if the federal court's intervention will deter such actions.</p>
