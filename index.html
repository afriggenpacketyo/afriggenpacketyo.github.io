          <p>GÃ©rard Depardieu was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set and was sentenced to an 18-month suspended prison term by a French court. The judges stated that the women provided consistent and credible accounts of being groped by the actor, with witness testimony supporting their claims. Depardieu denied all wrongdoing, and his lawyer said he would appeal the verdict. This case marks a major moment for France's reckoning with #MeToo, addressing broader questions about how sexual assault is defined, particularly within the film industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy faces a looming risk of stagflation, characterized by higher unemployment, higher inflation, and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the increased risks of these factors, though stagflation is not yet present. Swiftly shifting tariff policies and related uncertainty are major contributors to these fears, potentially causing businesses to delay hiring and investment. Consumers can prepare by paying down high-interest debts and boosting emergency savings, as experts suggest the Fed may lower interest rates if stagflation materializes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the US health secretary to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, aiming to align them with those in other developed countries. This move, announced via social media, initially caused a sharp fall in drugmakers' share prices, although skepticism later tempered the market reaction. The plan targets Medicare, Medicaid, and treatments covered by private health insurance, potentially including GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to strongly resist these changes, citing potential impacts on research and development investments.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's tariff policy reveals confusion among economists and trade experts regarding its goals and economic impact. Despite claims of trade "deals" with Britain and China, the actual agreements appear limited and temporary. The author questions Trump's belief that bilateral trade deficits are harmful and highlights the disruption of international trade relations caused by his policies, which has shaken trust in the U.S. as a reliable trading partner.</p>

          <p>Insurers are seeking to surcharge California homeowners to cover costs from recent Los Angeles County fires, following a $1 billion assessment on member carriers by the California FAIR Plan Assn. With approval from the state Insurance Commissioner, insurers are filing applications to surcharge policyholders statewide for half the assessment costs. The fees could range from a few dollars for renters to $40-$60 for homeowners. Consumer Watchdog has filed a lawsuit to stop the surcharges, arguing that the policy is unlawful.</p>
