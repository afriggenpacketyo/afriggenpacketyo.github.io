          <p>Catastrophic flash flooding in central Texas has resulted in at least 70 fatalities, with the majority occurring in Kerr County. Federal and state agencies, including FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard, have been mobilized for extensive search and rescue operations following a major disaster declaration signed by the president. Efforts are concentrated on locating survivors, including a number of campers and a counselor still missing from Camp Mystic on the Guadalupe River. The situation remains critical as first responders navigate the widespread devastation.</p>

          <p>A detailed look into the complex and protracted legislative process reveals how President Trump's major domestic policy bill narrowly passed through Congress before the July 4th holiday. The article chronicles the intense negotiations, procedural maneuvers, and marathon sessions in both the House and Senate that were required to secure the votes. Key moments included a nearly 16-hour reading of the bill, a record-long House vote, and a filibuster-style speech by the House Minority Leader. The passage highlights the challenges of governing with razor-thin majorities and the high-stakes nature of contemporary politics.</p>

          <h2>Texas Deluge Highlights Challenges of Forecasting Extreme Weather in a Changing Climate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The devastating floods in Texas, which saw rainfall equivalent to a 1,000-year event, underscore the increasing difficulty of predicting extreme weather. While the National Weather Service issued timely warnings, the sheer volume of rain far exceeded initial forecasts, raising questions about the capabilities of current models amid the climate crisis. The article notes that record atmospheric moisture, exacerbated by warming Gulf waters, contributed to the disaster's magnitude. This event serves as a stark example of how climate change is straining disaster preparedness and forecasting systems.</p>

          <p>Dutch cyclist Mathieu van der Poel secured a victory in the second stage of the Tour de France, narrowly defeating Tadej Pogacar in a dramatic sprint finish. The win, on the 209.1km route to Boulogne-sur-Mer, also earned van der Poel the coveted yellow jersey as the overall race leader. The stage remained relatively calm until the final 40km, when a series of attacks on punchy climbs created a separation in the peloton. Van der Poel, a pre-stage favorite, capitalized in the thrilling finale to claim his second career stage win at the prestigious event.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was temporarily halted due to a failure in the tournament's new electronic line-calling system. The technology failed to make a call on a crucial point, and after a delay, the umpire ordered the point to be replayed, a decision Pavlyuchenkova claimed "stole" the game from her. An All England Club spokesperson later attributed the malfunction to operator error. Despite the controversy and frustration, Pavlyuchenkova went on to win the match, but the incident has raised questions about the reliability of the automated system.</p>

          <p>The United States has deported eight men to South Sudan, a country on the brink of civil war, following a contentious legal battle. Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national; the others are from countries that reportedly refused to accept them. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that would have required due process hearings for migrants being sent to third countries. The move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to expand such deportations and raises serious concerns about the fate of the deportees.</p>

          <p>A family in Shoreham, New York, is living in a camper in their backyard after a contractor they hired for a major home renovation allegedly disappeared with their $96,200 payment. The contractor, Robert Cortese, gutted the house but then ceased all work, leaving the home uninhabitable. The family later discovered that Cortese was on the county's "Wall of Shame" for operating without a license, making them ineligible for a consumer reimbursement fund. The story serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of verifying contractor credentials to avoid devastating financial and personal consequences.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow delves into the complex life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, and his lasting impact on American culture. The article explores Twain's journey from a boy in Hannibal, Missouri, to a global literary icon whose sardonic humor was often rooted in personal pain and a fear of poverty. Chernow suggests that Twain's writings on politics, class, and race remain strikingly relevant today. The piece reflects on how Twain, through works like "Huckleberry Finn," both embodied and critiqued the American character, securing his place as a vital voice in the nation's history.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the potential elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." Responding to White House-led efforts to defund public media entities like PBS and NPR, Burns argued that such a move would disproportionately harm rural areas where PBS is often the only available broadcast signal. He emphasized that PBS provides essential services beyond arts programming, including children's shows, continuing education, and emergency information. Burns stated that his own extensive body of work would not have been possible without the support of the public broadcasting system.</p>

It posits that the failure to hold Israel accountable for its actions, such as the bombing of hospitals and using starvation as a weapon, is eroding established laws of war. The piece connects this international shift to domestic trends in Western nations, where pro-Palestinian dissent is increasingly suppressed, citing the example of a university student having her diploma withheld over activism.
