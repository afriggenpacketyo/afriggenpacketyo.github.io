          <p>Observers express uncertainty about the long-term consequences of the recent US attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, despite President Trump's claims of victory.  While the strikes dealt a blow to Iran's nuclear program, the long-term impact remains unclear, and the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran is uncertain.  Experts suggest that the actions could escalate tensions and make it harder for the US to build trust with other nations.  A preliminary US intelligence assessment suggests limited long-term damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>
