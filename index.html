          <p>With no clear indications of Iran being more inclined to negotiate, U.S. administration officials are framing President Trump's two-week timeline as an opportunity for diplomacy. A senior official emphasized that Trump seeks to provide Iran with a chance to reassess its stance, and communication has occurred between Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranâ€™s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The administration cites heavy losses among Iran's senior leadership and nuclear policy experts as a reason for this breathing room, while European diplomats are scheduled to engage in talks with Araghchi in Geneva, although some U.S. officials are skeptical of European handling of Iran. Despite Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu's preference against negotiating with Iran, the U.S. maintains its approach. The article provides relevant context to the current diplomatic tensions. </p>

          <p>Shares of Circle, a cryptocurrency firm, experienced a surge following the Senate's approval of the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins. The stock rose nearly 17% in premarket trading, continuing a rally that began after the bill's passage. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to increased interest from banks and payment firms amidst evolving crypto policies. The GENIUS Act aims to establish guidelines for stablecoin issuance, reserves, and compliance, while the House of Representatives is also working on similar legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, primarily driven by a "dismal" performance in supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Sales volumes decreased by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly fall since December 2023, with food retailers reporting lower sales of alcohol and tobacco. Separate figures revealed that government borrowing reached the second-highest level for May since 1993, while the ONS noted that consumers are cutting back due to inflation. Despite a 0.8% increase in sales volumes over the three months leading up to May, economists suggest that the initial economic growth spurt may be ending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's 150-day regular parliamentary session concluded on Sunday, preceding a crucial national election for the ruling coalition, which lost its majority in the House of Representatives last October. Opposition parties united to advocate for a bill eliminating a controversial gasoline tax, a move seen by some as a symbolic gesture before the House of Councillors election. The ruling camp aims to maintain control of the upper house amidst low public support and frustration over rising prices outpacing wage growth. While the gasoline tax bill's approval is unlikely, it underscores shifting power dynamics, forcing Prime Minister Ishiba to accommodate opposition demands. </p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has allowed Donald Trump to retain control over California's National Guard while the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, proceeds with a lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump's use of the troops. The court extended a pause on a ruling that Trump had unlawfully called the National Guard into federal service, finding that he failed to coordinate with the governor and that conditions for federalizing the guard did not exist. The lawsuit was prompted by Trump's decision to deploy troops against the wishes of Newsom amid protests in Los Angeles. The Justice Department argues that once the president determines an emergency exists, no court can review that decision. </p>

          <p>Apollo Global Management is set to provide a Â£4.5 billion loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK, signaling the growing interest of private credit markets in European infrastructure. The investment-grade debt financing package will be offered at an interest rate below 7%. This unsecured lending to EDF, the majority owner of Hinkley Point C, is considered a major private capital investment in a project of UK national interest. The project, which has faced delays and budget increases, is expected to generate electricity for around six million homes upon completion. (not investment advice)</p>

The expert also noted that even if there is some damage, Iran has the knowledge, experience, and enriched uranium to move forward with relative ease. Continued military strikes would not be a good option for Israel or the U.S. if the goal is an Iran without nuclear weapons. </p>
