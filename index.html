          <p>Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) stated that the Democratic Party's biggest mistake has been "not centering people enough," arguing that many voted for Donald Trump due to a lack of trust in Democrats' ability to deliver for them. Booker emphasized the need for the party to focus on the voices and needs of Americans rather than partisan politics. He referenced his recent 25-hour speech, during which he called for Democrats to do better and acknowledged the party's past mistakes that paved the way for Trump's rise. Booker also expressed gratitude for the millions who participated in protests against the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Vietnam has requested the United States to postpone the implementation of newly announced tariffs while the two nations engage in negotiations, signaling an early test of President Trump's willingness to adjust his protectionist trade measures. Deputy Prime Minister Bui Thanh Son met with U.S. Ambassador Marc Knapper to convey the request, emphasizing that the tariffs are inconsistent with the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. Another deputy prime minister will be visiting the U.S. to further discuss the matter and seek a resolution that benefits both Vietnamese and American businesses. Vietnam's economy has experienced significant growth in recent years due to increasing manufacturing and exports, making the U.S. its largest export market.</p>

Jones emphasized the need for the UK to build relationships with allies and invest in its own economy, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch disagreed that globalisation was over, pointing to strong trading relationships with other countries.</p>

The crossing will feature native plants, sound walls, and engineered soil designed to seamlessly integrate with the surrounding environment.

          <p>As the Trump administration intensifies its efforts to arrest and deport immigrants, routine check-ins with ICE have become increasingly perilous for those with pending cases or parole. Previously, immigrants complying with check-in requirements were often allowed to remain in their communities, but now, many are being detained and deported, even without criminal records. Lawyers are advising clients to prepare for potential detention during check-ins and to seek legal representation. The increased enforcement has created widespread fear among immigrant communities, with many feeling that "all bets are off" under the new administration.</p>

          <p>Homebuilders are facing a surplus of unsold homes, the highest since the Great Recession, leading them to offer incentives like mortgage rate buydowns and price reductions to attract buyers.

While this situation presents opportunities for buyers, some builders are slowing down construction to manage their backlog.

While critics express concerns about the impact on work-life balance, others view polyworking as a form of entrepreneurship and a way to hedge against unemployment.

The Justice Department maintains it has no control over Abrego Garcia and cannot arrange his return, while his attorney asserts the government has taken no action to rectify the error. The case has sparked outrage and concerns about the deportation of noncitizens with permission to be in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has announced a temporary halt to all shipments to the US in response to newly imposed tariffs, which include a 25% levy on car imports. Other carmakers are also considering actions, with Nissan potentially shifting production of US-bound vehicles to the US. The tariffs, part of President Trump's trade measures, have sent shockwaves through global supply chains, leading to market losses. While the United Auto Workers union has applauded the tariffs, the move has raised concerns about the impact on businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has faced criticism for supporting Israel's decision to deny entry to two UK Labour MPs, citing Israel's right to control its borders and questioning why other countries would deny entry to Labour MPs. Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey condemned Badenoch's comments, while senior Tory MP Richard Fuller expressed concern about democracy and the need to welcome MPs on official trips. The MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, were prevented from entering Israel to visit the occupied West Bank.</p>

          <p>Federal student loan borrowers are facing uncertainty due to legal challenges to the Biden administration's SAVE plan and changes to other repayment options. Borrowers should explore their options and understand the terms of their repayment plan to navigate the current landscape. The SAVE plan is currently blocked, but borrowers may remain in an interest-free forbearance, though it won't count towards loan forgiveness. Alternative IDR plans are available, but some benefits, like automatic loan forgiveness, are currently unavailable. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose tariffs on trading partners has sparked fears of recession and rising inflation among Americans, despite his claims of a "great time to get rich." The move has drawn criticism from global leaders and even within his own party, while economists warn of potential economic consequences. While some express concerns about the impact on their investments and the economy, others believe the tariffs are necessary to bring back American manufacturing. The situation has created an atmosphere of uncertainty as the long-term effects of the trade war remain unknown.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is increasingly concerned that China's regular military drills around the island could escalate into a real attack, leaving them with little time to respond. The PLA's large-scale joint combat drills are simulating amphibious landings and precision strikes, raising fears that a military exercise could quickly transition into an actual invasion. The island's military is concerned about its ability to react swiftly enough as China continues to erode buffer zones, with warnings that PLA warplanes could reach Taipei within minutes.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist explores the concept of interdependence in relationships, challenging the illusion of complete independence. Drawing from philosophical and feminist perspectives, the columnist argues that humans are inherently interconnected and that true love involves embracing vulnerability. The article encourages readers to examine the distinction between real and felt financial dependence, suggesting that fear of interdependence, rather than financial concerns, may be the root of resistance in sharing expenses with a partner. The author suggests that accepting interdepence is the best way to enrich one's relationships.</p>

          <p>This article praises B.J. Novak's film *Vengeance* for its accurate portrayal of the South, a region often misrepresented in cinema.

          <p>The National Zoo is now under scrutiny for potential ideological biases, following President Trump's directive to eliminate "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian Institution. The article explores potential reasons for the zoo's inclusion in the order, examining exhibits for signs of political messaging. The author finds little explicit advocacy but notes subtle distinctions, such as a panel on turkey hunting that contrasts Indigenous practices with European colonization, and the presence of Chinese pandas that have attracted interest from senators. The focus is on the balance between conservation and potential political influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author argues that a growing class divide in America, where the systems of education, hiring, and policy are managed by a "comfort class" disconnected from the financial struggles of most Americans, has led to widespread chaos and resentment. This class, born into financial stability, often lacks understanding of the challenges faced by those living paycheck to paycheck, resulting in policies that fail to address their needs. The author highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing classism to bridge the gap and create a more equitable society.</p>
