          <p>Shares of the British food delivery company Deliveroo experienced a significant increase following the announcement of a $3.6 billion takeover offer from the U.S. firm DoorDash, reaching their highest level in over three years. The company confirmed the offer after European markets closed on Friday, and promptly suspended its £100 million share buyback program. Deliveroo's board indicated it would likely recommend the offer to shareholders if a firm bid is made, as discussions with DoorDash continue, highlighting potential consolidation in the competitive food delivery market.

          <p>Real Madrid's Antonio Rüdiger is facing a possible suspension after throwing an object, believed to be an ice cube, at a referee during the Spanish Cup final, an act for which he has since apologized. The incident occurred amidst heightened tensions between Real Madrid and the referee, Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, with two other Real Madrid players also receiving red cards during the match. Former German international Dietmar Hamann has suggested that the German FA (DFB) should suspend Rüdiger, while Germany's national team manager Rudi Völler suggested the DFB were unlikely to ban the player, even if they condemn his actions. This incident follows previous controversies involving Rüdiger, including a throat-slitting gesture towards Atletico fans and shouting support for Athletic Bilbao after a win over Real Sociedad.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that a review of U.S. federal programs addressing HIV/AIDS, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), could improve their efficiency and effectiveness. While maintaining resources for tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic is critical, many programs have not been re-evaluated in years and may have unnecessary bureaucratic overlap. The Ryan White CARE Act, for example, could be reauthorized to better allocate funding toward substance abuse and mental health services. The piece suggests that streamlining initiatives and auditing for waste are necessary to ensure the U.S. continues to make progress in combating the disease.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) apprenticeship programs, designed to train workers for the growing EV industry, face uncertainty due to policy changes under the Trump administration, which has rolled back EV tax credits and pollution regulations.

However, Trump's policies threaten to reduce demand for EVs, potentially leading to plant closures and job losses.

          <p>As Canada's election day arrives, voters express diverse concerns and motivations, with the US relationship and domestic issues like cost of living and Indigenous affairs heavily influencing their choices. While some are voting Conservative due to dissatisfaction with the Liberal government's economic policies, others are voting Liberal, valuing Mark Carney's experience in dealing with the US. Several voters are prioritizing leadership and experience to navigate the economic challenges, while some are voting for the NDP to address Indigenous issues and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Katy Perry is scheduled to perform in mainland China in November, marking her first shows there since a controversial incident in Taiwan led to a previous visa denial. The concerts are planned for an 18,000-seat stadium in Hangzhou, eight years after she was reportedly denied entry for a Victoria's Secret fashion show in Shanghai. Perry's return to China comes as local policymakers seek to boost domestic consumption amid trade pressures from the U.S.</p>

          <p>As Democrats struggle with low approval ratings, the author argues against manufactured attempts at "coolness" and gimmicks, instead urging the party to focus on authenticity, passion, and substance. Rather than attacking incumbents or chasing fleeting trends, Democrats should prioritize doing their job and helping everyday people. Drawing examples from politicians like Bernie Sanders and Chris Van Hollen, the author emphasizes that authenticity and genuine concern are more effective than trying to appear trendy or relevant.</p>
