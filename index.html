          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a significant political crisis after a major rebellion from his own party‚Äôs MPs forced a humiliating U-turn on planned welfare reforms. The government had intended to alter eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip), but widespread internal opposition led to a chaotic reversal of the policy. This event has drawn parallels to previous unstable governments, severely weakening Starmer's authority and leaving his administration appearing bruised and out of control. The turmoil has also fueled speculation about inevitable tax hikes and potential changes in key cabinet positions.</p>

          <p>The Miccosukee Tribe is raising strong objections to a new migrant detention facility, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," being constructed in the Florida Everglades. Tribal leaders express serious concerns about the facility's proximity to their villages and the lack of an environmental impact study, fearing it could harm the delicate ecosystem and compromise the safety of their communities. The facility, which President Trump recently toured, is intended to hold up to 5,000 migrants in a remote, swampy area.

          <p>President Trump toured a new migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," praising its remote and treacherous location as a deterrent to illegal immigration. Accompanied by top officials, Trump highlighted the surrounding swampland, filled with alligators and pythons, as a natural barrier to escape, stating the only way out is deportation. The facility, built rapidly by the state, can house up to 5,000 people and may serve as a model for other centers. Critics have condemned the site as an inhumane prison camp, while the administration defends it as a key part of its immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>A 5-year-old girl who fell overboard from the Disney Dream cruise ship was heroically rescued by her father, who immediately jumped into the ocean after her. The incident occurred as the ship was sailing from the Bahamas to Fort Lauderdale. Authorities have clarified that the child was not being held over the railing, contrary to some online speculation, but appears to have climbed it while her parents were nearby. Maritime experts have lauded the father's quick actions and the ship's crew for the successful rescue, noting that such events often end in tragedy.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from prematurely ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security, under Secretary Kristi Noem, had sought to terminate the program in September, but the judge ruled the move unlawful for failing to follow congressional procedures. The court found that the interests of the Haitian TPS holders, who rely on the status to live and work in the U.S., outweigh potential harm to the government. This ruling provides a temporary reprieve for the immigrants, though the administration has vowed to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded instances. The Trump administration attributes this dramatic decrease to its aggressive immigration policies, including swift deportations and the cessation of migrant releases into the U.S. These numbers mark a significant contrast to the record-high levels seen under the previous administration. The administration's strategy also includes a large-scale interior enforcement campaign and a messaging effort encouraging self-deportation, though these tactics have drawn criticism from civil rights advocates and local politicians.</p>

The dispute centers on the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' a massive spending package endorsed by Trump. Musk criticized the bill for increasing the national debt and cutting support for renewable energy and electric vehicles, which could negatively impact Tesla's sales and energy division. In response, Trump suggested Musk could lose more than just his EV mandate, alluding to the substantial government contracts and subsidies his companies rely on. (not investment advice)</p>

The ban is a significant cultural shift for a nation long associated with smoking, although it does not apply to outdoor caf√© terraces, which remain a refuge for smokers.

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, a prominent televangelist who built a global ministry before being embroiled in high-profile sex scandals, has died at the age of 90. Swaggart rose to fame in the 1980s with his televised sermons, but his career was permanently marred after he was caught with a sex worker in 1988, leading to a tearful on-air confession. Despite being defrocked by the Assemblies of God and facing another scandal years later, he continued to preach from his Family Worship Center in Louisiana. He was also known for his controversial remarks on other religions and his gospel music career.</p>

          <p>Several traditional Fourth of July celebrations in Southern California have been canceled due to widespread fear within the community over recent immigration raids. Organizers of major events, including the Grand Park block party in downtown Los Angeles, cited the current climate of insecurity as the reason for postponement or cancellation. The unpredictable nature of federal enforcement actions has created a sense of unease, particularly in predominantly Hispanic communities, leading many residents to avoid public gatherings. This has cast a somber mood over a holiday typically marked by large, festive celebrations across the region.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it faces 153 legal claims of clergy sexual assault. Diocesan officials state that the financial reorganization is necessary to handle the claims equitably while ensuring the continuation of its ministry. However, attorneys for the survivors have criticized the move, calling it a delay tactic designed to shield the church from accountability and deny victims their day in court. The bankruptcy filing freezes the state court lawsuits, shifting the focus from individual trials to a protracted process of managing the church's assets and liabilities.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet medical journal estimates that the Trump administration's decision to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could lead to 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. Researchers found that USAID programs have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades by funding initiatives in global health, such as HIV medication distribution and child nutrition. The administration argues the agency is inefficient, but the study suggests that the relatively small taxpayer investment has yielded substantial life-saving results. The findings highlight the potentially devastating human cost of the administration's foreign aid cuts.</p>

The dry weather is already impacting farmers, who face higher costs for irrigation, and harming wildlife habitats.

This reform is intended to address the state's severe housing crisis by removing a tool that opponents, including labor unions and local homeowners, have used to delay or stop construction. The move signals a major political shift toward prioritizing housing abundance over the lengthy environmental review process.</p>

          <h2>Giant Invasive Tegu Lizard Spotted in Northern California Park</h2>

          <p>Park officials have issued a warning after hikers spotted a large, invasive Argentine black and white tegu lizard in a state park near San Jos√©, California. While this particular lizard, likely an escaped pet, was later captured, its presence highlights the threat of invasive species. Tegus, which can grow up to five feet long, are voracious predators that eat the eggs of native birds and reptiles, posing a serious danger to local ecosystems. Although legal to own as pets in California, they are illegal in states like Florida, where they have established breeding populations and caused significant ecological damage.</p>

          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic successfully advanced to the second round of Wimbledon, overcoming a stomach issue to defeat Alexandre Muller in four sets. While Djokovic recovered from a mid-match slump, the tournament saw a major upset as third seed Alexander Zverev was knocked out by Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in a five-set thriller. World number one Jannik Sinner, a potential semi-final opponent for Djokovic, cruised through his opening match with a dominant straight-sets victory. Zverev's early exit adds to a growing list of top-10 men's players eliminated in the opening days of the tournament.</p>
