          <p>West Virginia's governor has announced the deployment of 300 to 400 National Guard members to Washington D.C. to support the Trump administration's federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. This action follows a presidential executive order that federalized the city's local police force and activated the D.C. National Guard. The move has drawn protests and sharp criticism from local officials, who argue it represents a significant federal overreach, especially as violent crime rates are reportedly lower than during Trump's first term in office.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued via helicopter after spending two days trapped behind the Seven Teacups waterfalls in California. The man became stuck when the powerful hydraulics of the water forced him off his rappelling lines during a descent. The Tulare County Sheriff's Office initiated an extensive search after he was reported missing, eventually locating him with a drone before a California Highway Patrol helicopter was called in to perform the technical hoist rescue and bring him to safety.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has rapidly strengthened into a powerful Category 5 storm over the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the first of the 2025 season to reach this intensity. With maximum sustained winds reaching 160 mph, its outer bands are already impacting the northern Leeward Islands, prompting warnings for potentially life-threatening flash flooding, landslides, and storm surge. While the storm's core is currently forecast to remain at sea and pass north of Puerto Rico, its immense strength is being closely monitored by forecasters across the region.</p>

The riots, which also involved the rival Barrio 18 gang across two separate prisons, began in demand for the return of transferred gang leaders. The release follows a separate incident where 11 other guards were also freed, though the wider unrest resulted in the death of one prison official from a gunshot wound.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, offering authentic regional cuisines that go far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein and sweet-and-sour chicken. Using the diverse market of Singapore as a launchpad, these brands are introducing diverse flavors from regions like Hunan and Zhejiang, challenging old stereotypes about Chinese food. This culinary expansion is seen by some analysts as a form of soft power or "ping-pong diplomacy," potentially softening China's global image and boosting its cultural influence abroad.</p>

          <p>A Denver man lost $17,000 to a sophisticated scammer after being transferred during a legitimate call he placed to United Airlines' official customer service number. While trying to rebook a canceled flight, he was unknowingly connected to an imposter who charged him for a new ticket and then made a separate fraudulent $17,000 charge under a different alias. United's internal call logs show a significant discrepancy in the call's duration, and the airline has launched a review into how its phone system was compromised.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are strongly advising adults over the age of 60 to incorporate more salmon into their regular diets in order to better support their cardiovascular health. Salmon is a high-quality protein that is exceptionally rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which scientific studies have shown can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, reduce chronic inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. As the risk of heart disease increases significantly with age, experts emphasize that dietary choices, including the source of protein, play a crucial role in mitigating risk factors.</p>

          <h2>Meteorologists Explain Rapid Intensification Process Behind Hurricane Erin's Power</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 13:46:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin's explosive growth from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane is a textbook example of "rapid intensification," a process fueled by specific atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The storm's development was aided by low wind shear and its path over exceptionally warm ocean waters, with sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit. This phenomenon, which scientific consensus suggests climate change is making more common, allows storms to gain strength very quickly, complicating forecasting models and shortening timelines for emergency preparations on the ground.</p>

The revival aims to capture both the nostalgia of its former millennial customers and attract a new generation of Gen-Z shoppers.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has died at the age of 105. The former Royal Air Force flight lieutenant from Aberdeen, Scotland, was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his exceptional bravery during an attack on a German U-boat in 1944, during which he sustained 72 separate injuries but continued to pilot his aircraft. His passing marks the end of an era for the 181 individuals who received the prestigious award for their valor during the conflict.</p>
