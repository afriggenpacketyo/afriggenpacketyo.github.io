The Alberta Prosperity Project is advocating for an independence referendum, with some even suggesting joining the United States. While an independent Alberta remains unlikely, the issue is gaining traction, posing a challenge to Canada's next prime minister and highlighting the regional divide between the western provinces and the rest of the country.</p>

However, a computer science expert argued that transferring Chrome's ownership is technically feasible, but Google insists its contributions to the underlying Chromium project are unmatched.</p>

          <p>Five individuals have been arrested for allegedly submitting false claims for federal disaster relief funds related to the Los Angeles wildfires.
