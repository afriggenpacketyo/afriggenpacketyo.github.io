          <p>Dozens of lesser-known Chinese firms from across the aviation supply chain have flocked to the Paris Air Show to showcase their products to Western buyers, marking a significant shift from previous years when only major players like Comac were prominently featured. The number of Chinese companies attending the event has more than doubled, leading to the creation of a de facto country pavilion for the first time. These companies are vying for a place in the European market as domestic profits plateau amid economic slowdown and intense competition. Baoti Huashen, a titanium sponge specialist, noted the excessive competition in the Chinese domestic market, highlighting the importance of seeking opportunities abroad.

          <p>Chocolate prices in the UK have risen at the fastest pace on record in May, contributing to an overall increase in food costs, according to official figures. The main rate of inflation remained at 3.4%, while food prices grew for the third consecutive month, reaching the highest level since February of last year. Economists speculate that businesses are passing on recent increases in employer National Insurance payments to customers, exacerbating the situation. Chocolate prices have been particularly affected by poor harvests in cocoa-producing regions like Ghana and Ivory Coast, leading to all-time lows in chocolate stocks.

          <p>A goods train from China has arrived near Tehran, marking the first delivery under the new China-Iran rail corridor project, which aims to reduce delivery times significantly. This ambitious route traverses several Central Asian countries and could eventually connect to Africa and Europe. The rail corridor reflects deepening ties between China and Iran, particularly as the U.S. considers intercepting Iranian oil tankers to enforce sanctions. The overland route allows Iran to continue its exports and reduces its reliance on vulnerable maritime channels, positioning Iran as a central transit hub in Eurasia.

          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government, involving alterations to materials, dimensions, or compositions to reclassify products under lower tariff codes. This practice, which predates the Trump administration, allows companies to benefit from exemptions and reduce duty liabilities. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements into final products to qualify for lower duties, while others remove elements to ship them separately.

          <p>R. Kelly was hospitalized after prison officials allegedly gave him an overdose of medication, according to his lawyers, who claim it is part of an ongoing assassination plot. Kelly is serving time at the Federal Correctional Institute in Butner, North Carolina, after being convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering. His legal team filed a motion accusing the Bureau of Prisons of instructing another inmate to kill Kelly, which prosecutors have rejected as "repugnant."
