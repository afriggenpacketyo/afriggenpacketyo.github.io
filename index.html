          <p>This article outlines what businesses and services are open or closed on Juneteenth in 2025, now a federally recognized holiday. Most businesses, including Walmart, Target, Costco, and many fast-food chains, will remain open, though hours may vary by location, so it is best to check local store hours. However, banks and the stock market will be closed, as will U.S. Postal Service retail locations, although UPS and FedEx will operate normally. The article serves as a practical guide for planning activities on this holiday. Optimism regarding the holiday stems from the general freedom to continue commerce.</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing damage and injuries, leading to vows of retaliation from Israeli leaders who accused Iran of war crimes. Israeli Defense Minister stated that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be held accountable, and instructed the IDF to intensify attacks on strategic targets in Iran. This development occurs as President Trump considers direct U.S. involvement in the conflict, with reports indicating he has approved attack plans but awaits a final decision based on Iran's willingness to abandon its nuclear program. The situation reflects escalating tensions and potential for broader conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly approved attack plans targeting Iran's nuclear program but has not yet made a final decision on whether to proceed. Sources indicate that Trump is awaiting indications from Iran that they are willing to negotiate an end to their nuclear program. The potential strike could involve multiple attacks by American B-2 stealth bombers on Iran's underground Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, which is heavily fortified. Trump is also reportedly gauging the reaction of his base to potential military action, considering the security of U.S. bases, and seeking advice from Vice President JD Vance. The decision remains uncertain, with Trump stating he will make a final determination at the last moment.</p>

          <p>A source familiar with the intelligence reports that President Trump is becoming increasingly comfortable with the idea of military strikes against Iran's Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant. The strikes would involve multiple attacks on the facility, which is located deep inside a mountain. Trump is reportedly engaging with Vice President JD Vance to gauge the reaction of the MAGA base to potential strikes. The Israelis discovered that they did not eliminate all Iranian air defenses as previously believed, raising additional concerns. The Iranians have not responded to ongoing nuclear talks, possibly due to Trump's demand for unconditional surrender.</p>

Ishiba had previously indicated he would dissolve the lower house if such a motion was presented. The House of Councillors election is expected to proceed as planned in July, amidst ongoing challenges such as trade disputes with the United States.

          <p>The article discusses the difficulties associated with destroying Iran's nuclear facilities, particularly the Fordo plant, which is built deep underground and reinforced with concrete. The U.S. possesses the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) and the B2 Spirit stealth bomber, which are necessary to penetrate the facility. However, multiple strikes and potential ground deployment may be required to ensure complete destruction. A U.S. strike could trigger Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region, potentially escalating the conflict. The article also considers whether the U.S. would limit its targets to nuclear sites or expand operations to pursue regime change.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth celebrations across the country are facing new challenges, including safety concerns and reduced corporate support. In Bend, Oregon, organizers initially canceled their festival due to safety concerns, but another group revived it on a smaller scale indoors. West Virginia state employees no longer receive Juneteenth as a paid holiday. In Denver, the Juneteenth Music Festival was shortened due to decreased corporate funding. Despite these challenges, organizers in Nashville are planning their biggest Juneteenth festival yet, emphasizing the importance of celebrating Black culture and excellence. The holiday commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans.</p>

          <h2>VA Program Cuts Spark Concern for Veterans Facing Foreclosure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has ended the VA Servicing Purchase (VASP) program, which provided low-interest mortgages to veterans struggling to pay their home loans. This decision has sparked concern among veterans and lawmakers, as it leaves approximately 80,000 veterans at risk of foreclosure with fewer options for assistance. While other government-backed mortgages offer emergency options that don't raise interest rates, veterans with VA loans now face potentially higher monthly payments. Congress is considering legislation to replace VASP with a "partial claim" program, but the timeline for implementation is uncertain. The cut has left veterans terrified of losing their homes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. faces a shortage of air traffic controllers, prompting efforts to accelerate training and certification. Schools like Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University offer programs mirroring the FAA Academy, allowing students to start background checks early and potentially skip the academy. The FAA is also providing additional financial incentives and streamlining the hiring process. The training is rigorous, requiring spatial reasoning, short-term memory, and the ability to maintain calm under pressure. The goal is to fill critical positions and ensure the safety and efficiency of the nation's airspace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could cause instability in the solar system, potentially altering the orbits of planets, including Earth. Computer simulations indicate that these flybys could lead to planetary collisions or ejections, although the probabilities are relatively low. While the risk of Earth being involved in a planetary collision or ejection is estimated at 0.2 percent, this is higher than previous research suggested. Researchers emphasize that while these scenarios are possible, they are not probable. Still, the findings highlight the vulnerability of the solar system to external gravitational forces.</p>

          <p>Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel is calling on the UK government to repatriate Britons in Israel amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. She argues that the UK should support the US if it attacks Iran, even if it means using UK bases for assistance. However, reports suggest that the Attorney General has privately raised concerns about the legality of Israel's actions, potentially restricting the UK's ability to support US military action. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has called for any legal advice to be published, emphasizing the need to avoid another illegal war in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A gold-plated iron knife and fragments of armor, believed to have been made using advanced 5th-century techniques, have been confirmed as originating from Japan's largest ancient keyhole-shaped tomb mound. The Daisen Kofun, controlled by the Imperial Household Agency, is thought to be the mausoleum of Emperor Nintoku, though academic debate continues about the actual occupant. The artifacts were acquired by Kokugakuin University from an art dealer and had previously been held by a collector who participated in a survey of the tomb in 1872. The discovery provides further insight into ancient Japanese craftsmanship and burial practices.</p>
