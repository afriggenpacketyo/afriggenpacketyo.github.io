          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, prompting a large-scale manhunt. According to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, the inmates, some of whom face murder charges, may have received assistance from individuals within the department. The escape was discovered during a routine headcount, and authorities are investigating multiple security failures, including defective locks and inoperable security cameras. As of Friday night, three of the escapees had been apprehended, and the search for the remaining seven continues, with the FBI and Crimestoppers offering rewards for information leading to their arrest.</p>

          <p>Two Caribbean countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Haiti and St. Lucia, sent delegations to a high-level forum in Beijing, indicating a flexible approach by China in engaging with Taiwan's allies. While Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that relations with these countries remain stable, the presence of their representatives at the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum highlights Beijing's ongoing efforts to exert diplomatic pressure. Analysts suggest that this participation doesn't necessarily signal a shift in allegiance, but rather a pragmatic approach to diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Automatic gunfire was heard in central Gaza early Saturday, hours after the Israeli military announced it was preparing to advance farther into the territory. This comes amid intense Israeli bombardment and as mediators seek to broker a new temporary truce between Israel and Hamas. The conflict, ongoing since October 2023, has resulted in a significant number of casualties and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with the UN warning of widespread hunger due to a blockade on aid. Despite the fighting, Hamas has vowed not to release the remaining hostages unless Israel ends the war and withdraws from Gaza.</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing for a presidential election that will determine the future of the pro-European, center-left government's reform plans. The current president has been blocking the government's initiatives, leading to disappointment among voters. The election pits left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Tusk, against national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, who is supported by the opposition Law and Justice party. The outcome will decide whether the government can move forward with its agenda, including restoring the rule of law and liberalizing social policies.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump did not visit Israel on his tour of the Middle East this week, which has led some Israeli commentators to believe that relations between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be strained over Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already visited the White House twice since Trump's inauguration. DW's correspondent in Jerusalem, Tania Krämer, explores whether Trump and Netanyahu have fallen out over Gaza.</p>

          <p>Severe storms, including a possible tornado, swept through St. Louis, resulting in at least five deaths and widespread destruction. The storms tore roofs off buildings, blew out windows, and downed trees and power lines. Over 5,000 homes were affected, and approximately 100,000 customers remained without electricity. A 9 p.m. curfew was implemented in parts of the city as officials searched for potential victims. The National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down in the St. Louis area, and severe weather warnings were issued for other parts of the country.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has accused former FBI director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a coded social media post. The post, which featured seashells arranged to spell the numbers "8647", was interpreted by right-wing supporters as a call to harm the president. The Secret Service has launched an investigation, and Comey has since removed the post, claiming he was unaware of the violent connotation. This exchange is the latest in an ongoing conflict between Trump and Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017.</p>
