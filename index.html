          <p>Chaos erupted at a stadium in Nairobi, Kenya, where mourners had gathered for a public viewing of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga's body. Police discharged tear gas and fired shots to control surging crowds, leading to unconfirmed reports of several fatalities and multiple injuries. The unexpectedly large number of mourners prompted authorities to move the viewing to the larger stadium, but a security breach led to the violent dispersal. Following the unrest, dignitaries, including President William Ruto, paid their respects before the public viewing resumed for the widely revered political figure.</p>

          <p>According to sources, federal prosecutors in Maryland are expected to seek a grand jury indictment against John Bolton, the former national security adviser under President Trump, for allegedly mishandling classified documents. This development follows recent indictments of other Trump critics, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, raising concerns about politically motivated prosecutions. Bolton has consistently denied any wrongdoing, stating that no classified information was unlawfully removed or published in his 2019 memoir. The investigation stems from a search of his properties in August related to these allegations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is examining the social media accounts of immigration applicants to identify what it terms "anti-American" activity, according to agency director Joseph Edlow. This policy, part of a Trump administration directive, considers such views a significant negative factor in application decisions. Edlow specified that the focus is on activity that is "beyond the pale," such as supporting terrorism or the violent overthrow of the government, not on general political dissent. Critics argue the policy could be used to penalize noncitizens for exercising legally protected speech and weaponize immigration law.</p>

          <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, experienced a fall in a Capitol hallway on Thursday while heading to a series of Senate votes. The incident occurred as two environmental activists approached him with a question, though he did not respond to them. Assisted by his security detail, McConnell was able to get up and continue walking, waving to the individuals who had questioned him. This event adds to previous health concerns, including a fall in 2023 that led to a significant absence from the Senate. McConnell has announced he will not seek reelection and will retire in January 2027.</p>

          <p>President Trump is intensifying efforts to end the war in Ukraine, stating it is a top priority after his administration helped broker a ceasefire in Gaza. Ahead of a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump has shifted his tone, increasingly blaming Russia for the conflict's continuation and considering new sanctions to pressure Vladimir Putin. The administration is reportedly considering selling long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv as leverage to bring Russia to the negotiating table. This marks a notable change from Trump's earlier stance and reflects a gradual warming of relations with President Zelenskyy.</p>

McCallum also highlighted the persistent danger of terrorism, noting that MI5 and police have thwarted 19 late-stage attack plots since early 2020.

          <p>Amid record-high credit card debt and rising interest rates in the U.S., more consumers are facing lawsuits from creditors. While being sued can be alarming, hiring a lawyer is not always necessary. For straightforward cases where the debt is valid, individuals can respond to the lawsuit themselves to avoid a default judgment, which could lead to wage garnishment. Alternatives to court include negotiating a settlement or payment plan directly with the creditor, seeking assistance from a credit counseling agency, or, in cases of overwhelming debt, filing for bankruptcy to halt legal action through an automatic stay.

          <p>The European Court of Justice (CJEU) issued two key rulings related to air travel, generally siding with the airlines. In one case, the court determined that a lightning strike can be considered an "extraordinary circumstance," potentially exempting an airline from compensating passengers for long delays, provided the airline took all reasonable safety measures. In a separate case, the court ruled that a pet transported in an aircraft's hold is legally considered "baggage," not a "passenger." This limits the airline's liability for non-material damages for a lost pet to the standard compensation for lost luggage.</p>

Party leaders argue that letting the subsidies lapse would create a crisis for millions of American families who would face dramatically higher insurance premiums.

Forecasted temperatures exceeding 31°C (88°F) triggered the FIA's safety protocol, which is designed to protect drivers from potentially dangerous conditions. This designation, new for the current season, allows drivers the option to use special cooling vests in their cars to mitigate the effects of the heat.

          <p>This article explores how modern digital interactions are causing real-life relationships to resemble one-sided, parasocial connections typically felt with celebrities. As social media platforms prioritize algorithm-driven content over personal connections, interactions with friends and family become part of a passive stream of consumption, similar to entertainment. This shift reduces the expectation of reciprocity, a key component of genuine relationships. Experts note that as people are increasingly exposed to loved ones through screens, their minds may begin to process these social connections in a more two-dimensional, observational manner.</p>

          <p>A network of over 340 former U.S. national security officials has released a report warning that the United States is on a trajectory toward "competitive authoritarianism." The assessment, conducted by the group Steady State, uses intelligence analysis methods to evaluate domestic democratic decline under the Trump administration. The report identifies key indicators such as the expansion of executive power, politicization of law enforcement, and erosion of judicial independence. The authors conclude with moderate to high confidence that without organized resistance, the country risks further consolidation of executive dominance and democratic erosion.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans for a large arch, informally dubbed the "Arc de Trump," to be built as a gateway to Washington D.C. from Virginia. During a White House dinner, he presented models of the proposed "Independence Arch" to wealthy donors who are also funding another of his projects: a new $250 million ballroom at the White House. The arch is one of several renovations and additions Trump has initiated since returning to office, reflecting his background as a real estate developer. Critics may view the monumental project as a display of personal ambition.</p>

          <p>In an effort to break the ongoing government shutdown stalemate, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he offered Democrats a vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. However, he could not guarantee the outcome of such a vote, an uncertainty that Democrats found unacceptable. Democrats have been firm in their demand for a resolution on the healthcare premium subsidies before they will support a government funding bill. The offer and its rejection highlight the deep divisions preventing a deal, as the shutdown continues with the Senate failing for a tenth time to advance a GOP funding bill.</p>

          <p>This article examines the central role of soybeans in the global food system, noting that while many associate soy with vegetarian foods, the vast majority is used as animal feed to support meat-heavy diets. The U.S. is the world's second-largest producer, making the crop a key agricultural export, particularly to China. This reliance has exposed American farmers to geopolitical tensions, such as the recent trade war with Beijing, which has disrupted exports. The article also discusses the environmental impact of soy cultivation, including its link to deforestation in South America and its increasing use in biofuels.</p>

          <p>Following reports of lead in products like cinnamon and protein powders, health experts are advising consumers on how to minimize exposure to the toxic metal. While lead occurs naturally in the environment, added amounts in unregulated products like supplements can pose health risks over time, particularly for children. The CDC warns that lead can damage the brain and nervous system. To reduce risk, experts recommend prioritizing whole foods over processed supplements and looking for trusted third-party certifications, such as the USP label, on products to ensure they have been tested for safe levels of contaminants.</p>

The lawsuit claims the company knew about the carcinogenic fibers for over fifty years but continued to sell the product, only removing it from U.K. shelves in 2023. This legal action follows numerous similar cases in the United States, where the company has faced billions in legal claims.

          <p>The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has announced a "defense readiness roadmap" that includes making a bloc-wide anti-drone defense system operational within two years. This "drone wall" is a response to the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles in modern warfare and repeated airspace encroachments by Russia. The plan, part of a broader effort to fortify the EU's eastern borders and enhance defense capabilities, calls for closer integration of national armies and defense industries. The initiative reflects a strategic shift for the EU, which has traditionally played a minor role in collective defense compared to NATO.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth account of the Trump administration's intensive immigration crackdown in Chicago, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz." The operation, framed by the president as a military-style conquest to save a "dangerous city," has involved Border Patrol agents in tactical gear conducting raids and street arrests. In response, local officials and community activist groups have organized to resist the federal actions, creating a "Rapid Response" network to monitor ICE activity and inform residents. The aggressive tactics and the organized local resistance have created a tense and volatile situation throughout the city.</p>

          <p>A new study by the RAND Corporation indicates that the annual homeless count in Los Angeles County is significantly undercounting people, particularly in high-density areas like Skid Row, Hollywood, and Venice. Researchers found the official count missed nearly a third of the homeless population in these neighborhoods, coinciding with a rise in individuals "sleeping rough" without tents or vehicles. This shift is partly attributed to city programs that clear encampments, making the remaining unsheltered individuals harder for volunteers to spot. The undercount could misdirect resources away from those with the greatest needs.</p>
