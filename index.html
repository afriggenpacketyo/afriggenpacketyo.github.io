        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Prime Minister has criticized the decision to bar Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an upcoming Europa League match against Aston Villa, deeming it "wrong." This measure, implemented due to safety concerns by the Safety Advisory Group and West Midlands Police, stems from intelligence about potential protests and past violent incidents involving Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans. Both Conservative and Labour leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, condemned the ban, with some calling it a "national disgrace" and suggesting it sends a harmful message about Jewish fans' safety. UEFA stated local authorities are responsible for match security, while an independent MP supported the decision, citing latent safety risks that police might struggle to manage. The controversy underscores the challenges of managing public events amidst geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted two North Texas men, Cameron Arnold and Zachary Evetts, on terrorism and attempted murder charges for a violent July 4 attack on a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. The Department of Justice alleges the pair belonged to an "Antifa cell" that planned to target law enforcement with firearms and explosives, with an officer being shot during the incident. The indictment details extensive pre-planning, firearm training, and the use of encrypted messaging, while defense attorneys argue anti-government beliefs are not a crime.

          <p>Lifetime is developing a new true crime film, "The Idaho Murders," based on Bryan Kohberger's confessed killings of four University of Idaho students in November 2022. The production, starring Miles Merry, will revisit the gruesome events that shocked the nation and led to a widespread search for the perpetrator. Kohberger, a criminology graduate student, pleaded guilty to the murders weeks before his trial to avoid the death penalty, receiving a life sentence without parole and significant fines. This article highlights the ongoing public fascination with high-profile criminal cases and the impact of such tragedies on communities. The film aims to recount the details of the crime and its aftermath.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Adviser to President Trump, has been indicted on 18 federal charges related to the mishandling of classified documents. The indictment alleges Bolton illegally transmitted and retained national defense information, including intelligence on future attacks and foreign policy. Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated that anyone abusing power and jeopardizing national security will be held accountable. This article notes that Bolton, a vocal Trump critic, faces up to 10 years in prison per count, and his indictment follows similar charges against other Trump adversaries, raising questions about political motivations.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is preparing to meet senior Chinese leaders soon, signaling a re-engagement with Beijing while navigating a delicate balance between Washington and China. A key issue is whether Ottawa will lift tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, a decision complicated by ongoing US trade negotiations and potential impacts on Canada's auto sector. China's ambassador has linked lifting canola duties to Canada's EV tariff stance, creating pressure from western Canadian provinces to strike a deal, while Ontario's premier opposes lifting tariffs.

          <p>Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton has labeled reports about Ferrari potentially appointing Christian Horner as their future team principal as "distracting." The Daily Mail had indicated Ferrari was in discussions with Horner, who was dismissed from his role as Red Bull team principal in July following a period of performance decline and internal issues. Horner subsequently secured a substantial 60 million euro settlement from Red Bull, according to sources close to the team. Hamilton chose not to engage with the speculation, stating he would not "entertain rumors" about such a significant leadership change.

          <p>A federal appeals court has maintained its block on President Trump's deployment of federalized National Guard troops in the Chicago area, though allowing them to remain under federal control. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the administration failed to justify the deployment under Title 10, which requires evidence of a "rebellion or danger of a rebellion" or inability to execute laws with regular forces. The court found insufficient evidence that immigration protests in Illinois constituted a rebellion or significantly hampered federal officers.

          <p>Venezuelan fishermen, like Wilder Fernández, are living in fear of US military strikes in the Caribbean, part of an operation targeting suspected "narco-terrorists" linked to the Maduro government. Since September, US forces have conducted strikes on alleged "narco-boats," killing at least 27 people, with Venezuela's defense minister warning citizens to prepare for the "worst." Despite US claims of drug smuggling, no evidence has been presented, and experts question the legality of the strikes.

          <p>The US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its new $100,000 fee for H-1B worker visas, deeming it unlawful. The Chamber argues the fee overrides existing immigration law, which mandates fees be based on processing costs, and will make the program prohibitively expensive for US employers, particularly startups and small businesses. This policy, intended to prioritize domestic hiring, is seen as a blow to the technology sector which relies on skilled foreign workers.
