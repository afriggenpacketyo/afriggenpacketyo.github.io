          <p>For the second time in two days, Venezuelan military aircraft, identified as F-16 fighter jets, have flown over the USS Jason Dunham in international waters. U.S. Defense Department officials described the repeated action as a "game of chicken" and a "highly provocative move" intended to interfere with American counter-narcotics operations in the region. The incident follows a recent U.S. strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug-trafficking boat and a warning from President Trump that such actions would put the Venezuelan military "in trouble."</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants is unlawful. The decision allows approximately 1.1 million migrants from these nations to maintain their legal status to live and work in the U.S., citing dangerous conditions in their home countries. The Department of Homeland Security, which called the program a "de facto amnesty program," has indicated it will appeal the ruling from the "unelected activist judge."</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot approaches $1.8 billion, a new analysis shows significant disparities in lottery spending across the United States. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 annually on tickets, while North Dakotans spend the least at just $50. The report suggests accessibility in urban areas contributes to higher spending, noting that lottery sales constitute a notable portion of state revenue, reaching up to 3% in states like Rhode Island.</p>

          <p>Mark Volman, the singer who co-founded the 1960s band The Turtles and was part of the duo Flo & Eddie, has passed away at the age of 78 following a brief illness.

Volman was also a sharp businessman, famously winning a landmark lawsuit against De La Soul for unauthorized sampling, which reshaped hip-hop production practices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially endorsed Representative Ashley Hinson in her 2026 campaign for the Iowa Senate seat being vacated by retiring Senator Joni Ernst. Hinson, who is in her third term, launched her campaign by positioning herself as "President Trump's top ally." The endorsement from Trump, along with support from Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, solidifies her status as the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in a state that has trended increasingly conservative.</p>

          <p>A new draft of a major cryptocurrency bill in the U.S. Senate includes a provision to prevent tokenized stocks and other traditional securities from being regulated as commodities. The update to the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 aims to establish clearer jurisdictional lines between the SEC and the CFTC for digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope that the bill could reach the president's desk by the end of the year, though it still requires bipartisan support to pass. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, a certified public accountant advises potential winners on the crucial decision between a lump sum payment and a 29-year annuity. While the lump sum offers immediate control for investment, it can be "dangerous" due to overspending, whereas the annuity provides a "safe bet" against losing the fortune quickly. The expert strongly recommends that any winner should remain anonymous, assemble a team of legal and financial advisors, and prioritize paying off all debts before making major lifestyle changes.

          <p>A national scandal is unfolding in Australia after an independent consumer group found that numerous popular sunscreens fail to provide their claimed Sun Protection Factor (SPF). One prominent brand's SPF 50+ product tested as low as SPF 4, leading to a product recall and a probe by the country's medical watchdog. The revelations have caused public outrage and shaken consumer trust in a country with the world's highest rate of skin cancer, raising questions about sunscreen regulation and testing standards globally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of expectations and marking a significant slowdown in hiring. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised previous months' data downwards, revealing a job loss in June, the first since 2020. This disappointing report is the latest indicator of economic weakness, potentially exacerbated by President Trump's tariffs, and increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to stimulate the slumping economy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a report showing only 22,000 jobs were added in August, economists are warning of a faltering U.S. job market. Key takeaways include that hiring has stalled, with job growth at its lowest level in 15 years, excluding the pandemic. Experts attribute the slowdown partly to economic uncertainty from trade tariffs and suggest that without growth in sectors like healthcare, the overall numbers would be negative. The weak data makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month highly probable. (not investment advice)</p>

While the name will initially be a secondary title pending congressional approval, the move has drawn criticism from Democrats who argue it is a childish rebranding that promotes war rather than its prevention.</p>
