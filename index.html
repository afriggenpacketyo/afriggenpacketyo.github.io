This strategic pivot reflects the intensifying global economic competition and the efforts by traditional shipbuilding powers to reclaim market share and advance their maritime technology.</p>

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law that permits towing companies to sell seized vehicles after just 15 days is drawing sharp criticism from residents who label it as predatory. The article highlights the experiences of individuals who lost their cars over minor infractions like expired registrations and could not afford the fees in time. An investigation into one company, MyHoopty.com LLC, suggests that working-class neighborhoods are being disproportionately targeted by these practices.</p>

          <p>Contrary to some claims, the new tax law does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits but instead introduces a temporary "bonus" deduction for seniors. Policy experts explain that this new deduction, which is set to expire in 2028, primarily benefits higher-income individuals and does little for low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax. This approach could also place additional financial pressure on the long-term stability of the Social Security program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, where seven people had been reported unaccounted for. The blast destroyed multiple structures and ignited several grass fires, with a smoke plume reaching up to 15,000 feet. The facility, Devastating Pyrotechnics, was found to be operating without the necessary local licenses to store commercial fireworks on the agricultural property, which is now the subject of a multi-agency investigation.</p>

These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface before sinking deep into the Antarctic Ocean, where they effectively lock away vast amounts of carbon. Researchers calculate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions from 55 million gasoline-powered cars, a much larger climate benefit than previously understood.</p>

          <p>Germany began their Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. However, the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to team captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears during the first half. The injury to Gwinn, who has a history of two prior ACL tears, now casts a significant doubt on her ability to continue in the tournament.</p>

          <p>A new executive order signed by President Trump will increase entry fees for international visitors to U.S. national parks and give American residents preferential treatment in lotteries or permitting. The order also revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the management and storytelling within the park system. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending government DEI programs established under previous administrations and has drawn criticism for its potential impact.</p>

          <p>This article explores India's position as a potential counterweight to China's leadership within Global South alliances such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Because these groups require consensus for all decisions, India can effectively block initiatives it opposes. An example cited is a recent SCO defense ministers' meeting where a lack of consensus, reportedly due to India's stance on language regarding terrorism, prevented the adoption of a joint statement, showcasing Delhi's diplomatic leverage.</p>
