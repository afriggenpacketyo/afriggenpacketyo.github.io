          <p>President Trump's threat to impose significant tariffs, including a 50% charge on the European Union, faced uncertainty after judges blocked his across-the-board levies.

The legal challenges raise questions about the future of international trade relations and the potential for economic disruption.

          <p>The White House has strongly criticized federal judges who blocked President Trump from imposing global tariffs, calling it "judicial overreach" and urging the Supreme Court to intervene. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt argued that these judges are undermining the credibility of the United States on the world stage, as the administration believes the tariffs are crucial for scaling domestic manufacturing and securing supply chains. Leavitt highlighted the Senate's rejection of a measure to block Trump's tariffs, asserting that the courts should not interfere with the president's trade policy.

          <p>Arthur T. Demoulas, the CEO of Market Basket, has been placed on leave due to a renewed family feud within the company, an iconic New England grocery chain.

The court also finds that the tariffs do not effectively address the threat of drug trafficking, as claimed by the administration.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve meeting on June 18, where a rate cut could be discussed, may also affect gold prices due to the inverse relationship between gold prices and interest rates.
