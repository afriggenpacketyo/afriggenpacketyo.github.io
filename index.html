          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump expressed a new belief that Ukraine is capable of winning back all its territory from Russia. This marks a significant shift from his previous calls for Ukraine to concede land to end the conflict, a stance he had reiterated as recently as last month. In a social media post, Trump stated that the ongoing war is making Russia look like a "paper tiger" and that its economic troubles present an opportune moment for Ukraine to act with European support.</p>

          <p>In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump strongly criticized European nations for their immigration policies, claiming they were being "invaded by a force of illegal aliens." He drew parallels to the situation at the U.S. southern border, arguing that mass immigration depletes social safety nets and undermines national sovereignty. Trump urged all countries to defend their citizens and rejected the idea that large numbers of migrants should be allowed to cross borders, framing it as a threat to national culture and stability.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Ryan Routh guilty on all five charges related to the attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump at a golf course in September 2024. Routh, who represented himself, was apprehended after a Secret Service agent spotted him with a rifle before he could fire a shot. Following the verdict, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before being subdued by U.S. marshals; he now faces a potential life sentence in prison for the attack.</p>

          <p>Consumers are rushing to purchase electric vehicles to take advantage of federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs before they expire at the end of September. The credits, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out by new legislation, leading to a record surge in EV sales in August. Dealerships are also offering significant incentives to clear inventory, with some lease rates dropping to as low as $40 per month, though concerns remain about a potential sales drop-off in October once the credits are gone.</p>

Historically, the FCC has almost never revoked a license based on program content.

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on forested property in Pembroke, Maine. The landowner's family discovered the animal, with only its antlers visible, and alerted the state's wildlife department. In a five-hour operation, a biologist sedated the moose, and game wardens used straps and an excavator provided by the family to carefully lift it to safety. After the sedation wore off, the moose ran off into the woods, seemingly unharmed by the ordeal.</p>

          <p>Police in Beverly Hills are investigating a hate incident after a man was captured on surveillance video drawing a swastika on the sidewalk outside an elementary school. The symbol was discovered on Monday, which marked the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, adding to the antisemitic nature of the act. School district officials condemned the incident, stating that "hate of any kind is not acceptable" and reaffirming their commitment to student safety, while local police have increased patrols around Jewish community centers.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement an automated ball-strike (ABS) system, often called "robot umpires," starting in the 2026 season. Human umpires will continue to call balls and strikes, but teams will now have the ability to challenge two calls per game using the ABS technology, with reviews displayed on stadium videoboards. The system, which has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019, is expected to increase accuracy and reduce on-field arguments and ejections, a majority of which currently stem from ball-strike disputes.</p>

Without naming him, Powell's comments were a clear response to President Trump, who has repeatedly attacked the Fed for not cutting interest rates more aggressively and has sought to install political allies on its board. Powell reiterated that the Fed's decisions are driven by economic data, not political pressure, amidst an ongoing campaign by the administration to exert more control over the institution.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from CDC scientists, U.S. infection rates from carbapenem-resistant "nightmare bacteria" increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The rise is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics and leaves only expensive IV-administered drugs as a treatment option. Researchers warn that these once-rare bacteria may now be spreading unrecognized in communities, potentially turning common ailments like urinary tract infections into difficult-to-treat chronic problems.</p>
