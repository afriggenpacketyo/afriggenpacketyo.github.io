          <p>Former President Trump has set a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept a US-brokered peace plan for Gaza, warning of severe consequences for non-compliance. The 20-point proposal, endorsed by Israel, calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. However, the plan's path forward is uncertain, as Hamas has indicated it will likely reject the terms, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has reiterated his opposition to an eventual Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri set the fastest time during Friday's practice sessions for the Singapore Grand Prix, outshining his teammate Lando Norris. The session was eventful, featuring a pit lane collision where Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was released unsafely into Norris's path, breaking the McLaren's front wing. The practice was also disrupted by two separate red flags caused by crashes involving Mercedes' George Russell and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson, limiting the teams' ability to conduct race simulations.</p>

          <p>Production delays for China's domestically-produced C919 narrowbody jet are causing uncertainty among Chinese airlines, potentially creating an opportunity for its main rival, Boeing. Industry analysts suggest that if the state-owned manufacturer Comac cannot meet its delivery schedules, Chinese carriers may shift new orders to the American aerospace giant to satisfy their demand for new aircraft. This situation contrasts with Comac's earlier ambitious pronouncements to significantly increase its C919 production capacity in the coming year.</p>

With negotiations at a stalemate, the shutdown is likely to extend through the weekend, delaying key economic data like the September jobs report. Amid the deadlock, the Trump administration is threatening mass layoffs of federal workers and has frozen billions in infrastructure funding for projects in Democratic-led areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. sales of all-electric vehicles surpassed one million units in the first nine months of the year, driven by consumers rushing to purchase before federal incentives of up to $7,500 expired in September. Data shows Tesla maintained its market lead despite a drop in share, while General Motors saw significant gains, becoming the second-largest EV seller. Industry executives and analysts anticipate that the termination of these federal incentives will likely cause a sharp decline in EV sales in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new cybersecurity campaign, dubbed FileFix, is targeting Facebook and Instagram users with deceptive account suspension notices. The phishing attack tricks victims into pasting a hidden malicious command into their computer's File Explorer, which then installs the "StealC" infostealer malware. This malware is designed to harvest a wide range of sensitive data, including browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallet information, and private messages. Security experts advise users to be skeptical of urgent warnings and avoid copying commands from unverified sources.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are facing long-term unemployment as the nation's hiring market cools, with the share of those jobless for 27 weeks or more reaching its highest level in over three years. Despite a historically low overall unemployment rate, workers with extensive experience and new entrants alike report applying to hundreds of jobs with little success. Economists describe the situation as a "low-hire, low-fire" environment, where fewer new positions are being created, making it increasingly difficult for job seekers to re-enter the workforce.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has described the current excitement around artificial intelligence as an "industrial bubble," characterized by inflated valuations where both good and bad ideas receive funding. However, he emphasized that unlike purely financial bubbles, this one is based on a real and transformative technology. Bezos compared the current AI boom to past industrial bubbles, such as in biotechnology, arguing that once the hype subsides, society will reap "gigantic" benefits from the winning innovations that emerge.</p>

          <h2>England Manager Tuchel's Exclusion of Jude Bellingham Signals No Special Treatment for Stars</h2>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel's decision to leave superstar Jude Bellingham out of his latest squad is being interpreted as a clear message that no player is guaranteed a spot based on reputation alone. Despite Bellingham's desire to be included after recovering from shoulder surgery, Tuchel opted to reward players who performed well in the recent 5-0 victory over Serbia. The move suggests the manager is focused on building a cohesive team that is not solely reliant on one individual ahead of next summer's World Cup.</p>

          <p>Members of the Jewish community in Manchester have expressed feelings of shock, horror, and a grim lack of surprise following the deadly attack at the Heaton Park synagogue. Local residents described a rising climate of antisemitism in recent years, with incidents of verbal harassment becoming more common, leading to a pervasive sense of fear. The attack on Yom Kippur has intensified these concerns, with some families now questioning their future safety in the area and trying to explain the violence to their young children.</p>

The company cited safety risks identified by law enforcement, a move that followed public pressure from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. The controversy surrounding these apps intensified after it was revealed that a gunman who attacked a Dallas ICE facility had searched for such tools, though the app's creator maintains it was designed to help immigrants avoid deportation.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee stated that he is "a little wary" about cutting interest rates too quickly, citing risks to both sides of the central bank's dual mandate. He pointed to a recent uptick in inflation combined with deteriorating payroll numbers, which puts the Fed in a "sticky spot" where both stable prices and maximum employment are under pressure. While he believes the economy can support gradual rate cuts over time, he cautioned against front-loading them based on an assumption that inflation will simply disappear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have announced that one of the two victims killed in Thursday's synagogue attack may have died from a gunshot wound fired by a police officer. Chief Constable Stephen Watson stated that a provisional examination suggests the injury is consistent with a gunshot, and since the attacker was not armed with a firearm, it was likely an unforeseen consequence of officers' actions to end the assault. A second, non-fatally injured victim was also found to have sustained a gunshot wound during the incident.</p>

In sentencing, the judge described the attack as "brutal" and "beyond comprehension," noting that Gunter had a responsibility to care for his highly vulnerable son and had committed an extreme abandonment of that duty.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. retailers like Walmart and Kroger are increasingly replacing traditional paper price tags with electronic shelf labels, which allow for near-instant price updates. While companies tout the technology for its efficiency and ability to quickly offer discounts on perishable items, some lawmakers have raised concerns. They fear the digital tags could enable "dynamic pricing," where the cost of essential goods could surge during periods of high demand, though retailers currently deny any plans to implement such a system.</p>
