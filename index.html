        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OPEC+ countries agreed to keep their oil output quotas unchanged, with attention now focused on potential production increases from a subset of eight member nations that have been voluntarily cutting output. The entire OPEC+ group is currently reducing production by approximately 2 million barrels per day until the end of 2026. There is speculation that another production increase may occur in July, potentially as much as 411,000 barrels per day, which coincides with concerns about some members not adhering to their quotas. The group has called for an assessment of each country's sustainable production capacity to determine baselines for 2027.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rolled back Biden-era guidance that cautioned employers about including cryptocurrency and related digital assets in 401(k) plans. The 2022 guidance had urged "extreme care" due to concerns about fraud, theft, and loss. This shift is seen by some as an olive branch to the pro-crypto community, signaling that employers can add digital assets to retirement plans without consequence. However, some financial planners worry that this sends the wrong message, potentially exposing investors to significant risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations has criticized a new Israeli-backed aid operation in southern Gaza, a day after its launch was marred by chaos when thousands of Palestinians stormed a food distribution site, resulting in Israeli forces firing warning shots. The Israeli initiative aims to bypass the UN and Hamas, but humanitarian groups argue it is inadequate and violates humanitarian principles. The program replaces over 100 distribution sites with just four, requiring Palestinians to travel long distances through Israeli troops to receive aid. European diplomats have also criticized the program, emphasizing that aid should not be politicized or militarized.</p>

The company is working with vendors to offset costs and diversifying its sourcing network, reducing its reliance on China. Despite the challenges, Abercrombie slightly raised its full-year sales guidance, anticipating revenue growth between 3% and 6%. (not investment advice)</p>

The German Defense Ministry detailed the aid package, valued at roughly 5 billion euros, which includes cooperation in weapons construction, air-defense systems, and financing of satellite communications.

          <p>Mortgage rates have increased for the third consecutive week, reaching their highest level since January; however, demand from homebuyers has remained resilient. Mortgage applications for home purchases climbed 2% compared to the previous week and were 18% higher than the same week last year, indicating that increased housing inventory is supporting transaction volume. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 6.98%, but refinance applications fell by 7%.

          <p>The UK's top trade envoy to Israel, Lord Austin, traveled to the country to promote trade ties days after Foreign Secretary David Lammy suspended formal trade talks in protest at Israel's actions in Gaza. Lammy had called Israel's policies "egregious" and "damaging" to Britain's relationship with the country. The government defended Lord Austin's trip, stating he was there to maintain relationships with Israeli businesses, while the decision to cease trade talks sparked a furious response from Israel's foreign ministry. The situation highlights conflicting messages from the UK government regarding its relationship with Israel.</p>

          <p>A former French surgeon, JoÃ«l Le Scouarnec, was sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison for sexually abusing 299 people, mostly children, in what is considered the largest pedophilia case in French history. The trial revealed failures in the legal and health administrative systems, as the surgeon was permitted to continue treating children unsupervised despite a 2005 conviction for downloading child abuse imagery. The trial took place amid a growing reckoning in France over sexual abuse, though some victims felt it did not prompt the public outcry they had hoped for. The crimes occurred between 1989 and 2014, with victims' average age being 11.</p>

Attempts to contact Woldbye failed because his bedside phone was on silent, as senior staff decided to suspend operations following a fire at a nearby electrical substation. The closure, affecting 270,000 journeys, occurred because of an "unprecedented set of circumstances," according to Heathrow's chairman. The report recommended that Heathrow consider having a "second means of contact" to notify key individuals about critical incidents.</p>

Torigian argues that Xi Zhongxun's experiences reveal the nature of the Chinese Communist Party in the 20th century, highlighting the tension between human-ness and party-ness.

The 25% tariff on imported cars to the United States, coupled with the threat of a 50% tariff on all products from the European Union, has sent Porsche's shares tumbling. The company has scaled back its forecast for the year and is now reintroducing models with combustion engines and expanding its offering of plug-in hybrid vehicles.
