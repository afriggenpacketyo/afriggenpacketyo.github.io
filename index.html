          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of rocket launches to understand and mitigate the impact of noise pollution from frequent spaceflights. With companies like SpaceX increasing the pace of launches, the noise, including sonic booms, is becoming a growing concern for communities near launch sites. Researchers are focusing on understanding how sound waves travel and how to lessen disruptions. SpaceX is also testing Starship, the largest rocket ever, which is likely to be the loudest; therefore, it is imperative to address rocket noise before problems become pervasive and entrenched.</p>

The visit, filled with diplomatic symbolism, highlighted Canada‚Äôs sovereignty and independent future, with citizens expressing a desire to distance themselves from the United States. This event follows Charles's diplomatic forays, including hosting President Volodymyr Zelensky and inviting President Trump to Britain.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes in Gaza resulted in at least 52 deaths, including 36 at a school-turned-shelter, prompting renewed concerns about humanitarian aid access. The Israeli military claims to have targeted militants operating from within the school, while Palestinians report the facility was hit multiple times as people slept. As concern grows over food shortages, a new U.S.-backed aid system is expected to begin operations, although it has been rejected by U.N. agencies and other aid groups. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health reports that around 54,000 Palestinians have died in the offensive.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed rare criticism of Vladimir Putin, calling him "absolutely crazy" as Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine since the start of the war. Despite this, Trump has not taken action by joining Europe in imposing new sanctions on Russia or offering additional aid to Ukraine. The Kremlin downplayed Trump's remarks, while European leaders expressed hope that his anger would translate into action. This escalation follows a broken ceasefire and preparations for a Russian summer offensive.</p>

          <p>Seventeen Greek coastguards have been charged in connection with the 2023 migrant shipwreck off Pylos, in which up to 650 people are feared to have drowned. The charges follow claims that the coastguards caused the boat to capsize during a towing attempt and subsequently silenced witnesses. Greek authorities have consistently denied these allegations, but survivors feel vindicated by the charges, although they remain skeptical of the Greek legal system. The incident occurred in international waters within Greece's rescue zone, and the investigation has cast doubt on the official Greek version of events.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in Arkansas for Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault, who escaped from a high-security prison. Hardin, 56, was discovered missing during a routine inmate count and is considered extremely dangerous. He was last seen wearing a makeshift law enforcement uniform, and authorities believe heavy rain has hindered the search. Hardin's criminal history includes multiple terminations from law enforcement positions and a previous guilty plea in a 1997 sexual assault case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning significant cuts to intelligence and national security jobs across the government, raising concerns about potential impacts on national security. The restructuring of the National Security Council, characterized by mass dismissals, continues a trend of radical downsizing. With the U.S. government relying on intelligence officials to maintain security, these cuts could have serious implications for America's safety at home and abroad.</p>

          <p>Democrats view the Republican vote against California's electric vehicle mandate as an attack on the state's autonomy and influence. For decades, California has set its own emissions regulations, effectively setting standards for carmakers nationwide. Republican lawmakers argue that California's policies should not govern other states and that electric vehicles are impractical for their constituents. The move reflects a broader ideological clash between Republican states and California's progressive agenda.</p>
