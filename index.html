          <p>President Trump discussed his first 100 days in office in an exclusive ABC News interview, covering topics such as the economy, immigration, and foreign policy. He defended his administration's immigration policies and reassured Americans about the economy, citing lower prices for gasoline and groceries. Trump also addressed concerns about his use of presidential powers, framing them as necessary to heal a "sick" country, and suggested that Vladimir Putin might be trying to manipulate him in Ukraine peace talks. The article notes Trump's remarks on Elon Musk's efforts to cut government waste and fraud, with referrals being made to the Department of Justice. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to ease some automotive tariffs, aiming to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports. The new measures address concerns about the additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum "stacking" on top of existing import duties. While the 25% tariff on imported vehicles remains, automakers can qualify for partial reimbursements on parts-related levies for two years if they conduct final assembly in the U.S. The administration hopes to incentivize automakers to bring parts production back to the U.S., with Trump stating the administration will strongly penalize those who do not comply.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is under scrutiny after 100 days, marked by efforts to cut government agencies and the federal workforce. While Musk promised trillions in cuts, the savings so far have been far less, with many cost-saving claims being called into question. DOGE's efforts to slash the federal workforce have also faced criticism, with potential costs outweighing the savings. Despite these challenges, the Trump administration defends DOGE's cost-cutting goals, while Musk claims to be eliminating a "dictatorship of the bureaucracy."</p>

Despite the challenges, Carney vowed to protect Canada's interests and build an independent future for the country.

Hair follicles, which house stem cells, help quickly close up wounds in mice or monkeys. By comparison, “human skin has very puny hair follicles,” and our ancestors lost many of those follicles, packing their skin with sweat glands instead.</p>
