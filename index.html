        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Multiple sources have informed CBS News that U.S. officials have been briefed on Israel's readiness to launch an operation into Iran, with the U.S. anticipating potential retaliation against American sites in neighboring Iraq, prompting the State Department to advise some Americans to leave the region. Despite these tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy plans to proceed with a sixth round of nuclear program talks with Iran, while Iran's Defense Minister warned of targeting U.S. bases in host countries should conflict arise. The U.K. Maritime Trade Organization has also cautioned ships in key waterways due to increased regional tensions, as Israel has been historically skeptical of deals with Iran, conducting operations to hinder its nuclear program, which dates back decades and is claimed to be for peaceful purposes. The article highlights the delicate balance of international relations and the potential for escalation in the Middle East. Optimism surrounding the situation is low, given the potential for conflict.</p>

          <p>Robert Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary, has appointed new members to the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) after dismissing the previous panel, citing the need to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science. The new members include individuals with diverse views, some of whom have expressed skepticism about vaccine safety and efficacy, particularly regarding mRNA vaccines. This decision has sparked concern among physician groups, including the American Medical Association, which has called for a Senate investigation into the dismissals. The move is seen as controversial, given Kennedy's long-standing vaccine skepticism and allegations of conflicts of interest within the previous panel, without providing specific evidence. The situation introduces uncertainty regarding future vaccine recommendations and public health policy.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating between President Trump and California Governor Newsom as protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) continue to grip Los Angeles and spread to New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Austin, Texas, and other cities. In Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass issued an overnight curfew for a square mile in the downtown area due to clashes between police and protesters. Trump has deployed 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to LA against the wishes of Newsom and Bass, prompting Newsom to sue the Trump administration for unlawfully trampling over Californiaâ€™s sovereignty. The situation reflects a deep divide over immigration policy and federal versus state authority.</p>

          <p>Japan remains at 118th place out of 148 countries in the 2025 gender gap rankings, making it the worst among the Group of Seven nations, according to the World Economic Forum. The report indicates that Japan has made some improvements in women's participation in the economic sphere but lags significantly in political empowerment, ranking 125th due to the low representation of women in government and the absence of a female prime minister. While the world has seen major improvements in women's economic participation and political empowerment, the think tank estimates it will take 123 years to reach full parity globally. The article suggests that Japan needs to accelerate its efforts to close the gender gap to align with other advanced economies.</p>

The review also allocates more money for artificial intelligence and transport projects, aiming to "renew Britain." However, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget squeezes. The government hopes that increased spending in health and investment in longer-term projects will reassure voters, while many departments will have to manage with frugal day-to-day spending allocations.

The board members claim the administration denied awards to previously selected candidates and initiated an unauthorized review process for 1,200 foreign award recipients. They believe these actions undermine the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence, contradicting the Fulbright mission and values. The State Department, however, contends that the board members were partisan political appointees and that the administration's actions are necessary to ensure alignment with President Trump's Executive Orders.</p>

The move comes as the U.S. pushes allies to increase military spending, with the review led by Elbridge Colby, who has previously questioned the deal.

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics indicates that gun deaths among children have risen in states with lax firearm laws over a 13-year period. States like Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, and Georgia saw a jump in pediatric gun deaths after amending their firearms restrictions following a 2010 Supreme Court ruling. The study found that youth deaths increased significantly in states with more permissive firearm laws, while states with the most restrictive laws saw stable or decreased pediatric gun deaths. The research suggests a strong correlation between stricter gun laws and the prevention of youth firearms deaths.</p>
