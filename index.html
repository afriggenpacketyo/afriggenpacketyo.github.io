        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices by tying the amount the government pays for some medicines to lower prices abroad, a policy known as the "most favored nation" approach. The order directs agencies to crack down on "unreasonable and discriminatory policies" in foreign countries that suppress drug prices. It also encourages drugmakers to offer "most favored nation prices" and directs the HHS Secretary to set price reduction targets, potentially leading to negotiations with the pharmaceutical industry and possible rulemaking to impose the pricing if progress isn't made. The policy is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it would hurt profits and innovation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is escalating his push to eradicate homeless encampments by calling on cities and counties to effectively ban tent camps on public property. Newsom's administration has allocated billions to address homelessness, but this move signals a tougher approach, providing a template for local ordinances to outlaw encampments. While cities aren't mandated to adopt the ban, its issuance coincides with the release of over $3 billion in state-controlled housing funds that local officials can use to put his template in place. The model ordinance allows cities to decide penalties, but guidance suggests avoiding criminal punishment for sleeping outside without alternatives.</p>

Washington and Beijing agreed to lower tariff rates by 115% for 90 days as negotiations continue. The previous high tariff rates had effectively amounted to a trade embargo, impacting oil prices and pressuring U.S. shale oil producers who need higher prices to drill profitably.

Lowering interest rates through balance transfers, debt consolidation loans, or negotiating with creditors is also crucial.

          <p>With persistent inflation, saving money can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help by offering higher returns. Current national average CD yields vary by term, with the 1-year CD at 2.00% APY and the 5-year CD at 1.69% APY. To get a good CD rate, consider online banks, which typically offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs.
