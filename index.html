          <p>EU heads of state are urgently advocating for quicker action to unlock and utilize frozen Russian assets, aiming to finance Ukraine's critical military and defense efforts for 2026-2027. A leaked draft document reveals their call for the European Commission to promptly present concrete proposals regarding the use of cash balances associated with these immobilized assets. Concerns about potential financial and legal issues post-war are significant, especially for countries like Belgium, which hosts Euroclear holding a bulk of these assets, leading to calls for fair burden-sharing among G7 partners. This renewed push for European financial support follows reduced U.S. aid and underscores the continent's increasing responsibility in sustaining Ukraine's defense, highlighting the evolving geopolitical landscape and financial strategies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venezuela's UN ambassador, Samuel Moncada, has vehemently condemned a series of U.S. strikes in the Caribbean, labeling them as "extrajudicial executions" and calling for an urgent UN Security Council investigation. Moncada reported five lethal attacks resulting in 27 deaths since September, alleging that the U.S. is targeting "civilian vessels" under the pretext of combating suspected drug traffickers. While the U.S. justifies these actions as necessary against "narcoterrorists," Venezuela is pushing for a Security Council statement to reaffirm state sovereignty, though U.S. veto power likely limits substantive action. This diplomatic confrontation underscores escalating tensions and legal challenges surrounding the U.S. military operations in the region, demanding international attention.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Duggan is appealing his extradition from Australia to the United States on charges of illegally training Chinese military aviators over a decade ago. Duggan, who worked for a South African flight academy in 2012, is accused of conspiring to provide training without a proper license. He denies the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated by the U.S., which he believes has unfairly targeted him, especially given his Australian citizenship during the alleged actions. His lawyers argue legal flaws in the extradition process, emphasizing the unusual extraterritorial nature of the charges and the broader geopolitical implications between the involved nations.</p>

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, who leads U.S. Southern Command overseeing operations in the Caribbean, is set to retire in December, significantly earlier than the typical three-to-four-year posting. His unexpected departure comes amidst growing controversy and a fifth deadly U.S. strike against alleged drug boats off Venezuela, raising alarms among lawmakers. The Trump administration justifies these attacks by treating suspected drug traffickers as unlawful combatants. However, frustration is mounting on Capitol Hill, with Democrats arguing the strikes violate U.S. and international law, and some Republicans seeking legal justification for these contentious military operations.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Warn Japanese Political Instability Could Impede Diplomacy with China and South Korea</h2>

          <p>Japan’s increasingly turbulent political landscape is expected to cast doubt on its diplomatic commitments and could significantly hinder progress in its trilateral summit with China and South Korea, according to analysts. With Sanehisa Takaichi aiming to become the country's first female prime minister, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is struggling to secure a stable majority in the House of Representatives. Experts suggest that regardless of the next prime minister, no single political party is likely to maintain a stable government, which would consequently weaken Japan’s ability to engage effectively in major diplomatic events and potentially stall momentum in critical regional frameworks.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced a new $1,000 immigration fee for migrants granted humanitarian parole in the U.S., aimed at strengthening oversight and preventing misuse of the system. According to DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, this measure by the Trump administration seeks to institute accountability and deter rampant fraud, asserting that the previous administration "abused" the parole system. The fee, which may be annually adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index, will be collected by Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Citizenship and Immigration Services.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has announced sweeping new curbs on rare earth exports, tightening Beijing's near-monopoly on these critical minerals essential for technology ranging from smartphones to fighter jets. Under the new rules, foreign companies now require Chinese government approval and must declare the intended use for products containing even tiny amounts of rare earths. This strategic move has escalated the trade war with the U.S., with President Trump threatening additional tariffs in response. Analysts suggest these restrictions give China significant leverage ahead of anticipated trade talks between Trump and President Xi Jinping, as the U.S. and its allies are years away from developing alternative supply chains for these vital resources.

          <p>A long-acting injection to prevent HIV, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use on the NHS in England and Wales, aligning with existing policy in Scotland and marking a significant advancement in public health. Administered every other month, this injection offers a convenient and discreet alternative to daily pills for HIV-negative individuals at high risk of contracting the virus. Experts hope this "game-changing" treatment will significantly contribute to the UK's ambition of ending new HIV cases by 2030, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations for whom oral PrEP is challenging to adhere to. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) anticipates offering the jab in NHS-operated sexual health clinics in the coming months, expanding access to vital prevention.</p>

          <p>The article explores a significant cultural shift that has made discussing sweat less taboo, largely influenced by celebrities like Alan Carr, Emma Stone, and Adele openly sharing their experiences with perspiration. This normalization is further driven by the rise of wellness trends, such as saunas becoming popular networking hubs for professionals, and the beauty industry actively promoting a "sweaty makeup" aesthetic. While scientists remain skeptical about claims of "sweating out toxins," they universally acknowledge sweat's crucial physiological role in regulating body temperature and its evolutionary importance.

          <p>Sol Bashirian, owner of the decades-old Italian restaurant Sunday Gravy in Inglewood, California, reports his business is "barely breaking even" due to the compounding pressures of rising tariffs and inflation.

Financial analysts note that eateries catering to lower- and middle-income consumers, and their customers, are particularly struggling with cost pressures across various fronts, including rent and groceries. With many restaurants planning price hikes, Bashirian has added a 5% surcharge to offset costs, fearing that further increases could deter his loyal customer base. (not investment advice)</p>
