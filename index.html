          <p>A suspect has been charged with murder and other offenses after allegedly carrying out an "act of terrorism" at a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was allegedly heard yelling "Free Palestine" while using a "makeshift flamethrower" and throwing an incendiary device at the crowd, injuring eight people. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideology, and the attack is being condemned as an act of antisemitism, especially as it occurred on the eve of the Jewish holiday, Shavuot. All upcoming Run for Their Lives events have been canceled until further notice following the attack.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The changes, the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, will allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impact. The government says UKADS will be fully operational by the end of this year, which comes after there were about 2.7 million flights in UK airspace last year. Aviation Minister Mike Kane says modernizing airspace is one of the simplest ways to help reduce pollution from flying and will set the industry up for a long-term, sustainable future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US defense sector is heavily dependent on China for critical minerals essential for advanced weapon systems, creating a vulnerability for the Pentagon's military readiness and supply chain security. China dominates the global supply of rare earths and other critical minerals like gallium and antimony, leveraging this dominance in trade negotiations. Beijing has imposed export restrictions on these minerals, affecting American military end users, and has expanded trade restrictions requiring special export licenses for various rare earth elements and related products. This dependence poses a significant risk as Beijing tightens export controls.</p>

          <p>China has criticized U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for his remarks labeling China as a threat in the Indo-Pacific, accusing him of espousing a "Cold War mentality." The Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that Hegseth's speech was "filled with provocations" and intended to sow discord, while reiterating that the Taiwan issue is China’s internal affair. The ministry also accused the U.S. of deploying offensive weaponry in the South China Sea, stoking tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. Hegseth vowed to boost U.S. defenses overseas to counter any possible threat from China, while insisting that allies in the Indo-Pacific also contribute more to their own defense.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Family Dynamic" by Susan Dominus, explores how sibling relationships and birth order influence a person’s life trajectory. Studies suggest eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention. Sibling influence can be powerful, with individuals often spurred to achieve success in different fields by what their siblings are doing. Siblings act as vivid mirrors, reflecting both positive and negative traits, which can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself, as well as a sense of being wholly known for best and worst traits.</p>

          <p>USC suffered a 14-1 loss to Oregon State in the NCAA Corvallis Regional final, setting up a winner-take-all rematch on Monday. Oregon State's aggressive play and strong pitching stifled USC's offense, leading to a lopsided victory for the Beavers. USC loaded the bases with no outs in the fifth inning but failed to score, highlighting their offensive struggles. The winner of Monday's game will advance to face Florida State in the Super Regional. USC coach Andy Stankiewicz said the team needs to regroup and come out ready for the decisive game.</p>
