          <p>A meeting between White House officials and congressional leaders ended without a deal, making a federal government shutdown appear increasingly probable. Following the discussion, Vice President JD Vance stated that a shutdown seems imminent due to the Democratic party's positions on funding. Democratic leaders, including Chuck Schumer, acknowledged that significant differences remain between the two sides but suggested the meeting was partially constructive as their objections were heard. Both parties continue to blame each other for the potential lapse in government funding, with the deadline just days away.</p>

Authorities allege the suspect, Nigel Edge, opened fire from a boat in what they describe as a premeditated attack. The investigation revealed that Edge suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and had a history of filing lawsuits against local authorities. The incident has prompted calls from the governor for improvements to the mental healthcare system to address individuals exhibiting threatening behavior.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have confirmed that the individual who attacked a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas was acting alone and specifically targeting ICE agents.

The attack resulted in the death of one detainee and critical injuries to two others who were inside a targeted van. Officials stated that Jahn used a legally purchased rifle from a nearby rooftop before taking his own life at the scene.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the student financial aid startup Frank, has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase in a $175 million acquisition deal. A jury found Javice guilty of fabricating customer data, falsely claiming her company had over five million users when it had fewer than 300,000. The fraud was discovered months after JPMorgan purchased Frank in 2021 to expand its reach among young consumers. During the sentencing, Javice expressed remorse, but the judge emphasized the need for deterrence in cases of such significant corporate fraud, also ordering millions in forfeiture and restitution.</p>

The system will also notify parents if it detects signs of potential self-harm and automatically applies stricter content filters for linked teen accounts.

With their regular businesses on hold, these guides are using state-funded grants to remove debris, including car parts and housing materials, that litters the riverbanks. This community-driven effort not only provides work for the unemployed guides but also helps restore the river, which locals have nicknamed the "New-lichucky" due to its altered landscape.

Democrats are refusing to pass a short-term funding bill without concessions on healthcare, while the White House has threatened to use a shutdown to permanently downsize federal agencies. The article explores whether this threat is a bluff, noting legal and political obstacles to such a move, but also acknowledges the administration's history of pushing executive authority. Ultimately, Democrats are betting that the political fallout of a shutdown will harm Republicans more, a risky calculation given the potential for unprecedented administrative actions.</p>

The analysis comes as former President Trump reiterates threats of a 100% tariff on movies made outside the U.S., a move experts say is logistically complex and could provoke international retaliation.

          <p>The U.S. President, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, has publicly presented a 21-point plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The proposal, which they stated has support from many Arab nations, was urged upon Hamas for acceptance. Netanyahu warned that if Hamas rejects the deal, Israel would "finish the job" on its own, while the U.S. president affirmed that Israel would have America's "full backing" in that scenario. Key elements of the plan reportedly include the demilitarization of Gaza and the establishment of a peaceful civilian administration without Hamas involvement.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has launched a new permanent menu line of protein-enhanced lattes and cold foam drinks in the U.S. and Canada, a move seen as a key part of its ongoing turnaround efforts. Analysts view the new products favorably, suggesting that tapping into the consumer trend for protein could broaden the company's customer base and significantly boost sales. The launch is the first major innovation under CEO Brian Niccol's new stage-gate testing process, designed to ensure new products resonate with customers before a wide rollout. The success of these beverages could help restore investor confidence in the company's growth strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit to prevent the federal government from deploying 200 National Guard troops to Portland, an action state officials warn is unjustified and will escalate tensions. The deployment follows claims by the White House that the city is "war ravaged" and federal facilities are under attack, assertions that local leaders vehemently deny. Oregon's governor stated she told the president he was acting on "bad information," as protests have been small and manageable. The move is seen as the latest in a series of deployments of federal forces to Democratic-run cities, which critics argue is a politically motivated action.</p>

          <p>The Taliban administration in Afghanistan has ordered a complete, indefinite shutdown of the country's fiber optic internet network, leading to a nationwide connectivity blackout. According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the shutdown has also severely impacted telephone and mobile services, as they rely on the same infrastructure. The move is an extension of recent regional internet cuts, which the Taliban justified as a measure to prevent "immorality" and "vice." This unprecedented nationwide blackout is expected to have a devastating effect on the country's banking sector, economy, and basic communication, isolating the nation from the rest of the world.</p>

          <p>A stress physiologist argues that the most effective way to manage stress is not through inward-focused self-care, but by channeling stress energy outward to help others. The author's research suggests that stress is a social experience, releasing oxytocin which motivates connection, making solitary coping methods often ineffective. The article proposes "stress springboarding," using feelings of being overwhelmed as fuel for meaningful actions like assisting a colleague, volunteering, or supporting a friend. This approach is said to activate reward centers in the brain and reduce stress-related activity, offering both personal and professional benefits by transforming stress into a catalyst for positive contribution.</p>

The article reflects on how the 2020 World Series moment motivated Snell to become a more durable and efficient pitcher, capable of going deeper into games.

          <p>Famo, a traditional accordion-based music genre from the mountain kingdom of Lesotho, has become dangerously intertwined with gang warfare. Originating as the folk music of shepherds and mineworkers, the genre has evolved into a medium for rivalries where artists trade insults in their lyrics, which then escalate into real-world violence and killings. The situation has become so severe that the government has banned some famo groups, labeling them as terrorists. The violence, likened to 1990s rap beefs, has infiltrated politics and law enforcement, reflecting deep-seated social issues in one of the world's poorest countries.</p>
