          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 07:49:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The filibuster's role in the Senate is increasingly precarious, with both parties strategically weakening it over time, as the article describes. Republicans recently circumvented the 60-vote threshold to pass a bill striking down a California air pollution law. As a sweeping bill containing much of President Trump's domestic agenda looms, Republicans face pressure to bypass the parliamentarian if decisions don't align with their goals. Senator John Thune predicts Democrats will use Republican actions as justification to abolish the filibuster when they regain control, continuing a cycle of partisan retaliation that undermines Senate traditions. The article explores the evolving dynamics of this parliamentary procedure and its implications for legislative gridlock and policy outcomes.</p>

          <p>Best Buy has lowered its full-year sales and profit projections, citing the increasing costs of consumer electronics due to higher tariffs, the article reports.

CFO Matt Bilunas stated that the outlook assumes current tariff levels will persist and consumer behavior will remain consistent with recent trends.

          <p>A recent US court ruling blocking some of President Trump's trade tariffs has a limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US, the article states. The tariffs ruled illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the bulk of UK exports to the US. While the UK has reached an agreement with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, this deal has yet to be implemented. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on goods like salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal, creating uncertainty for businesses.</p>

          <p>A South African court sentenced a woman to life in prison for kidnapping and selling her 6-year-old daughter, Joshlin Smith, who has been missing since February of last year, the article details.

Judge Nathan Erasmus ruled that the woman, along with her boyfriend and a mutual friend, should be jailed for human trafficking and kidnapping.

          <p>Nearly a year after a Texas family of four went missing in Alaska, their boat and human remains have been discovered in Kachemak Bay, as described in the article. Private companies located the sunken vessel in 180 feet of water, prompting a state-led recovery effort. Divers retrieved three sets of remains, which are being examined for identification. The missing family, including Mary and David Maynard and their two sons, disappeared after their boat capsized, leading to an extensive but ultimately unsuccessful search by the U.S. Coast Guard last year. The discovery brings a somber resolution to the search, though the exact cause of the incident remains unclear.</p>

          <p>A federal court in New York blocked President Trump's plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world, creating a setback for his trade policy, the article reports. The court ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Wendy Cutler suggests the decision throws the president's trade policy into turmoil, potentially tempting negotiating partners to hold off on concessions. The ruling leaves in place other tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, but the administration is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on an experience in Prague where a stranger corrected her child's behavior, contrasting it with the more individualistic approach to parenting common in America, the article describes. Historically, child-rearing involved more communal oversight, with neighbors and strangers feeling empowered to correct a child's misbehavior. The author argues that this collective approach can be beneficial, as it reinforces lessons and helps children understand the expectations of polite society. While acknowledging potential drawbacks, the author expresses openness to more direct involvement from others in guiding her children's behavior.</p>
