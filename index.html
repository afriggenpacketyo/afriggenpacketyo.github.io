          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn and former Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee, announced their departure to form a new law firm. This follows criticism of Paul Weiss's chairman, Brad Karp, for making a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order restricting the firm's business. The deal, which limited Paul Weiss lawyers' ability to enter courthouses, sparked controversy and led to similar deals by other firms. Dunn had been supportive of the decision to strike a deal with Mr. Trump and was part of the firm's leadership team that worked with Mr. Karp in getting other partners‚Äô support. The departing partners did not directly address the Trump deal in their farewell email.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans Police Department's use of facial recognition technology, particularly through its partnership with Project N.O.L.A., is facing scrutiny amidst the manhunt for escaped inmates. While the technology aided in recapturing one fugitive, concerns have been raised by the ACLU and some members of Congress regarding privacy and constitutional rights. Project N.O.L.A. operates approximately 200 facial recognition cameras throughout the city, scanning faces, clothing, and license plates. The police superintendent had ordered a pause in automated alerts from the group until she is sure that the use of the app meets all the requirements of the law and policies.</p>

          <p>The White House is undergoing a restructuring of the National Security Council, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also serving as national security adviser. The NSC staff is being reduced by at least half, with some officials reassigned and others placed on administrative leave. Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser, Andy Baker, will take a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser. Some of the reassignments don't take place until next week, one source said. One former member of the National Security Council said, "It's terrible.

          <p>A new study indicates that Anna's Hummingbirds have adapted to human influence, particularly backyard feeders, resulting in changes to their beak size and shape. The beaks have become longer and more slender, allowing them to access more nectar from feeders, and male beaks have grown pointier for fighting off rivals. This adaptation has also contributed to the expansion of the hummingbird's range northward. The study compared museum specimens from the 1800s to modern birds, highlighting the rapid pace of evolution.</p>

Klopp defended the Liverpool-born player's commitment to the club during his tenure. Alexander-Arnold is leaving the club at the end of the season and is expected to join Real Madrid. Some fans turned against the player and some booed him when he came off the substitutes bench against Arsenal earlier this month.</p>

The couple were shot again and again as they left an interfaith event about ‚Äúturning pain into purpose‚Äù ‚Äî a night dedicated to humanitarian collaboration, including efforts to aid civilians in Gaza. Asrarguis emphasizes Milgrim's commitment to cross-cultural dialogue and peace-building, particularly her work with Jewish and Muslim communities.

The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap.

The policy - which prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017 - was introduced in 2017 by the then-Conservative government and is estimated to affect 1.5 million families.</p>
