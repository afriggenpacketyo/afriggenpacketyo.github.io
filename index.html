          <p>Burberry is set to reduce 1,700 jobs globally by 2027 as part of organizational changes amid a luxury market downturn. The company's sales fell 6% in the fiscal fourth quarter, slightly less than the anticipated 7% decline. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment and early stages of turnaround efforts, CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future growth and profitability. The company also noted geopolitical tensions as a key downside risk, particularly regarding potential tariff impacts.</p>

          <p>Sony Group's shares experienced a rise of over 2% following the announcement of a share buyback program worth up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year surpassed analyst estimates, despite being down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of its shares to shareholders through dividends. While the outlook for the current financial year is lackluster due to potential tariff impacts, Sony clarified that the recent trade deal between the U.S. and China could alter the actual impact.</p>

          <p>Following high-level trade talks in Switzerland, the United States and China have agreed to reduce the majority of their newly imposed tariffs on each other's imports. The U.S. has lowered tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China has reduced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products from 125% to 10%. Both countries will retain a portion of their tariffs for further negotiation during a 90-day pause, and China will suspend non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals. These steps signal a potential easing of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie has pledged to address Britain's 'crisis of trust' by expanding fact-checking services, countering disinformation, and enhancing local journalism. Davie argues that the BBC can play a crucial role in strengthening democracy, boosting education, and improving digital access. He also proposes using artificial intelligence in the BBC's Bitesize educational service to create personalized learning companions for children. Davie calls for a national plan to transition to internet-only delivery of programs in the 2030s, potentially launching a streaming media device to aid those who haven't switched to streaming services.</p>

          <p>Kanye West, also known as Ye, released a controversial song praising Hitler, which is illegal in Germany due to strict laws against Nazi symbols and hate speech. The song, referencing "Heil Hitler" and featuring artwork resembling a swastika, has been banned on several platforms but remains on X. German law prohibits the public display or dissemination of Nazi symbols, punishable by imprisonment or a fine.

Despite backlash from fire survivors and state senators, Lara assured residents that he considered all options, balancing the need to protect State Farm customers and the integrity of the insurance market.

          <p>Ahmed al-Doush, a British Bank of America analyst, has been sentenced to ten years in a Saudi Arabian prison for allegedly violating terrorism and anti-cyber crime laws.

Al-Doush's international counsel asserts that his trial and detention involved violations of fair trial and due process.

          <p>New climate data from oyster fossils challenges the long-held belief that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, approximately 140 million years ago. The research indicates that the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced seasonal temperature changes similar to today, with the presence of polar ice. Scientists suggest these findings offer insight into modern-day climate change, particularly concerning the reduction of Arctic and Antarctic ice. The study highlights the transition from a world with perennial glacier ice to one with only seasonal ice, or a shift from a predominantly white winter planet to a blue one.</p>

          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors like health and social care. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrants, aiming to 'back British workers over cheap overseas labour'. However, businesses fear that British workers are either unable or unwilling to fill the gap created by potential worker shortages. The care industry, already facing 131,000 vacancies, warns that the immigration plans could have serious consequences.</p>

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reportedly presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from participating nations. While a spokesman for Witkoff denied the proposal, it has sparked debate and raised questions about its feasibility and potential impact on regional relations.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices fell in April for the first time in months, dropping to an average of $5.12 per dozen after hitting a record $6.23 in March. Despite this decrease, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has decimated egg-laying hen populations. Experts predict further price declines in May and June due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks. President Trump has focused on lowering egg prices, with the USDA investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures.</p>

          <p>U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risk posed by Chinese-made power inverters, crucial for renewable energy infrastructure, after undocumented communication devices were discovered inside some of them. These devices, including cellular radios, provide additional communication channels that could bypass firewalls, potentially destabilizing power grids and causing blackouts. The Chinese government denies any malicious intent. Utilities are preparing for potential bans on Chinese inverter manufacturers, seeking equipment from alternative sources to mitigate security vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>HMP Five Wells, once hailed as the UK's first "smart" prison, is facing safety concerns as it now houses a high number of sex offenders. Inmates and their families report a rise in violence, self-harm, and drug use due to the integration of sex offenders with the general population. Some inmates are struggling to cope with being housed alongside those convicted of sexual assault, while families express concerns about the safety of their children during visits. Data shows a significant increase in assaults and self-harm incidents since the integration began.</p>

Research indicates that public opinion in Poland towards Ukrainian refugees is worsening, with fewer Poles in favor of accepting them compared to previous years.</p>

Both countries will retain a portion of their tariffs for further negotiation during a 90-day pause, and China will suspend non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals.
