          <h2>Navigating Shopping Amidst Evolving U.S. Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 07:30:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With fluctuating tariff policies causing consumer uncertainty, shopping expert Trae Bodge offers advice on how to save money. Key tips include looking for sales events like Memorial Day and Amazon Prime Day, checking the origin of products to understand tariff impacts (especially considering the USMCA agreement), and purchasing domestic goods to avoid price hikes on imported produce. Bodge advises against panic shopping, suggesting instead that consumers accelerate planned purchases of big-ticket items like dishwashers or laptops. This strategic approach helps mitigate potential price increases due to tariffs. Optimism remains relatively stable as consumers are given actionable steps to avoid the worst of economic issues.</p>

          <p>Toyota has unveiled a redesigned version of its all-electric vehicle (EV) in the U.S., renaming it the 'bZ' from 'bZ4X' for the 2026 model year, likely to distance it from its poorly reviewed predecessor. The original bZ4X faced criticism and a recall due to wheel detachment issues. The 2026 bZ addresses these concerns with a 25% increase in EV range and up to 50% improvement in horsepower. These upgrades aim to enhance the vehicle's competitiveness in the EV market, improving the outlook for Toyota's EV offerings.</p>

          <p>Gold is experiencing a resurgence in popularity as buyers and bankers seek refuge from economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The price of gold has risen significantly, driven by events such as COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and Trump's trade policies. Central banks are buying gold to diversify assets, and consumers are increasing purchases of gold bars and coins. Billionaire investor John Paulson predicts that gold prices could reach $5,000 an ounce by 2028 due to central bank buying and trade tensions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Philadelphia is holding an official day of remembrance to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1985 MOVE bombing, in which police dropped a bomb on the headquarters of a Black liberation organization, killing 11 people, including five children. The bombing followed a prolonged siege and resulted in the destruction of 61 houses. Despite the devastation, no city official was ever criminally prosecuted, and the city only apologized 35 years later. The commemoration will be held at the site of the bombing, with plans to convert the rebuilt house into a memorial.</p>

          <p>Many Black, Latino, and young voters who supported Trump in 2024 are now expressing regret due to economic conditions and perceived betrayals of campaign promises. These voters, who were disengaged and historically Democratic, feel that Trump has not delivered on his promises to improve affordability and moderate policies. While they are dissatisfied with Trump, they are not necessarily returning to the Democratic Party, indicating a broader disillusionment with politics. This trend suggests that both parties face challenges in retaining and engaging these swing voters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has cut its China tariffs from 145 percent to 30 percent for a temporary period, with China reciprocating by lowering its retaliatory levies from 125 percent to 10 percent.

The move suggests that the U.S. needs trade with China as much as China needs trade with the U.S., undermining Trump's negotiating position. The tariffs, however, remain much higher than before Trump's second term.</p>
