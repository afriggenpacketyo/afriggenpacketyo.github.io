          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut, lowering the deposit facility rate to 2% from its mid-2023 high of 4%. This decision follows a drop in Euro zone inflation to 1.9% in May, below the ECB's 2% target. The ECB also released updated economic projections, anticipating an average inflation rate of 2% in 2025, revised down from the March forecast of 2.3%, primarily due to lower energy prices and a stronger euro. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that the outlook for euro area inflation remains more uncertain than usual, while the growth forecast for 2025 remains unchanged at 0.9%.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a travel ban on citizens from 12 nations, including seven African countries, has caused anxiety in South Africa, even though it is not on the list. People seeking visas at the U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg expressed concerns about potential mistreatment upon arrival in the U.S. The ban, aimed at protecting Americans from dangerous actors, cites risks ranging from terrorism to visa overstays. This announcement comes shortly after a second group of white South African Afrikaner "refugees" departed for the U.S. under a program that fast-tracks resettlement, while the administration works to suspend other refugee programs.</p>

          <p>NBA teams have generated $1.62 billion in sponsorship revenue this season, marking an 8% increase from last year and a 91% rise from five years ago. The growth is attributed to the expansion of sponsor patches on team jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. The increase in jersey patch deals, common in international soccer, has more than doubled year-over-year, contributing over $80 million in new spending. Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase are the top-spending brands in the league, with Chase sponsoring the Golden State Warriors' arena and Rakuten having a patch on their jersey.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble plans to cut up to 7,000 jobs, or approximately 6% of its global workforce, over the next two years in response to tariff-related costs and consumer anxiety about the economy. The job cuts, representing about 15% of its non-manufacturing workforce, are part of a broader restructuring program that includes ending sales of some products in certain markets. This decision comes as U.S. consumer sentiment has fallen for five consecutive months, and a Congressional Budget Office analysis indicates that President Trump's tariff plan could shrink the economy and raise inflation. The company is exploring sourcing options and productivity improvements to mitigate tariff impacts, potentially raising prices on some products. </p>

          <p>The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in China is expected to alleviate labor shortages in the long term, but its short-term impact on deflationary pressures is a subject of debate. Morgan Stanley analysts suggest that AI-induced labor market disruption could worsen deflation due to potential labor displacement. However, Standard Chartered's chief Greater China economist, Ding Shuang, argues that AI will not be a primary driver of deflation, attributing it instead to overcapacity in some industries and weak domestic demand. Ding emphasized that China should continue developing AI as a strategically important industry.</p>

The administration's actions are seen as an attempt to apply "America First" protectionist principles to higher education. International students have played a crucial role in buoying American universities and driving research and innovation.

          <p>The article analyzes how tariffs could affect the price of goods such as shoes and sweaters, highlighting that U.S. shoppers could face significantly higher costs for clothing imported from China and Vietnam. Retail consultancy group AlixPartners created pricing models showing that under a current 30% tariff, the price of a men's cotton sweater and shoes made in China would rise by about 19%. If the suspended 145% tariff were implemented, the price of those items would spike by roughly 90%. Retailers are using strategies to offset costs, but tariffs could still take a major toll on U.S. households.</p>
