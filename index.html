          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 10% increase after the company launched its Model Y robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, available to invited Tesla enthusiasts, promoters, and shareholders. CEO Elon Musk celebrated the launch on X, highlighting the decade-long development by Tesla's AI software and chip design teams. Early users reported positive experiences, though some observers noted potential traffic rule violations. This event marks a significant step for Tesla in the autonomous vehicle market, despite ongoing scrutiny regarding safety and regulatory compliance. The launch is a culmination of Tesla's efforts to create fully autonomous vehicles, with Austin being the initial testing ground for this technology.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding in Venice faced protests, including one from Greenpeace, highlighting concerns about billionaires avoiding taxes and contributing to climate change. The protest featured a banner criticizing Bezos for renting Venice while allegedly not paying enough taxes. Local activists also protested, expressing concerns about tourism impacting residents' needs. The wedding is expected to attract numerous high-profile guests and cost between €20 to €30 million, while Bezos plans to donate €1 million to Venice's lagoon ecosystem research, and the city has reintroduced an entry fee for day-trippers to manage tourism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, proposed a plan allowing non-domiciled UK residents to pay a £250,000 fee to avoid certain UK taxes, with proceeds directed to the lowest-paid workers. The party estimates this policy could generate £1.5bn to £2.5bn annually. Critics, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies, question the plan's financial viability and potential impact on affordable housing and revenue loss. Labour and Conservative spokespeople criticized the policy as a giveaway to foreign billionaires and fantasy economics, respectively. The proposal comes as the Labour government considers revising its own plans to abolish non-dom status, amid concerns of wealthy individuals leaving the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump used social media to demand that "everyone" keep oil prices down following U.S. strikes on Iran, warning that higher prices would benefit "the enemy." U.S. crude oil prices subsequently declined slightly. Trump's message comes amid concerns that escalating conflict in the Middle East could disrupt energy supplies and cause global oil prices to spike. He also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling, although oil production decisions are primarily made by private companies based on market dynamics. The oil market has been relatively stable despite geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, several tankers initially diverted from the Strait of Hormuz due to concerns over potential disruptions to trade. Data indicated reluctance from shipowners to enter the area, but some vessels later resumed their course towards the Strait. Reports of electronic interference and GPS jamming added to vessel owners' worries. Some companies, like Frontline, are avoiding the area due to increasing insurance costs and potential dangers.

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Steve Hill, an expert in war studies, suggests Iran has various retaliation options that could avoid provoking further attacks from the U.S. He believes Iran might aim for a "sweet spot" by retaliating enough to satisfy its population without triggering additional U.S. military action. Hill emphasizes the need for Iran to balance demonstrating strength with avoiding escalation. This analysis provides insights into the potential strategic calculations guiding Iran's response to the recent U.S. military intervention.</p>

          <p>While tech stocks, including Apple, previously acted as a safe haven during market volatility like the COVID-19 pandemic, this role has shifted recently. Apple's underperformance has raised questions about the sector's stability, even as broader tech indices have rebounded. Investors are now diversifying into traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples, indicating a broader approach to managing risk.

          <p>The United States bombed Iran on Saturday night, joining an Israeli-led offensive aimed at demolishing the Iranian nuclear program. President Donald Trump, claimed that the US had won a great victory, stating that the attacks were a “spectacular military success,” that “totally obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program. The article delves into the reasons behind the U.S. attack, the success of the strikes, the historical animosity between the U.S. and Iran, and potential retaliatory measures by Iran. It also examines the controversy surrounding the attack among Republicans and the broader implications for regional stability and global security.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's political team launched a political action committee (PAC) targeting GOP Rep. Thomas Massie's congressional seat in 2026, after Massie questioned Trump's authority to strike Iran. The move signals a new strategy to hold congressional Republicans accountable for supporting Trump's legislative agenda. Massie co-sponsored the War Powers Resolution to prevent Trump from striking Iran without congressional approval. Trump criticized Massie's dissent, and the Trump campaign responded by launching the Kentucky PAC, indicating a willingness to challenge Republicans who undermine the president's policies.</p>

          <p>Researchers have observed killer whales in the North Pacific engaging in a behavior called "allokelping," where they use kelp to massage each other. Using drones, scientists filmed the orcas selecting and rubbing pieces of kelp between their bodies. This behavior is believed to serve multiple purposes, including health, hygiene, and social bonding. The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, demonstrate tool use in killer whales, as they fashion tubular pieces of seaweed for a specific, planned purpose.</p>

          <p>Compass is suing Zillow, alleging that the online property website is violating antitrust laws with a new rule that bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow.

The lawsuit alleges that Zillow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website and that it is aimed at hobbling competition. Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings that it says can better serve sellers.</p>

          <p>A heat wave is forecast to bring several days of record-high temperatures across much of the United States. The National Weather Service has called it "the first significant heat wave this season". More than 150 million Americans are under the highest-level extreme heat alerts. The heat index is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity, and meteorologists say it's due to a heat dome. The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say.</p>

          <p>The United States conducted air strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, which American officials say have significantly set back the prospect of Tehran building a nuclear weapon. Codenamed Midnight Hammer, the operation involved 125 US military aircraft and targeted three nuclear facilities: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. US Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, disclosed more details during a press conference. Since then, President Trump has said the strikes caused "monumental damage", adding in a social media post: "Obliteration is an accurate term." Iran is weighing its response to the strikes, and there have been mixed reactions from world leaders.</p>

          <p>Amazon's second batch of Kuiper internet satellites reached low Earth orbit, adding to its plans for a massive constellation and ramping up competition with SpaceX's Starlink. A United Launch Alliance rocket carrying 27 Kuiper satellites lifted off from a launchpad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Monday's mission was rescheduled twice, owing to inclement weather and a problem with the rocket booster. This launch marks a significant step for Amazon in its efforts to provide global internet access through its Project Kuiper.</p>
