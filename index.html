          <p>Pony.ai, a Chinese autonomous-driving firm, intends to broaden its robotaxi services worldwide, leveraging China's cost-effective automotive production capabilities. CEO James Peng noted their robotaxis are significantly cheaper than Waymo's due to a more integrated supply chain. The company unveiled its seventh-generation autonomous system and three robotaxi models at the Shanghai Auto Show, developed with Toyota, BAIC Group, and GAC. Pony.ai plans to begin mass production of these robotaxis in the third quarter of this year, anticipating wider adoption and increased self-driven taxis due to reduced costs.</p>

          <p>The United States has reduced its representation in ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia in London, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff withdrawing. These talks, aimed at securing a ceasefire, will proceed with senior officials from the UK, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the US, hosted by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. The US decision may be due to a lack of new information since the Paris meeting or concerns about Ukraine's potential rejection of the US ceasefire plan. Amid these developments, reports suggest Russia might be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in exchange for recognition of its sovereignty over Crimea, a proposal Ukraine rejects.</p>

          <p>The European Union has imposed substantial fines on Apple and Meta for violating the bloc's digital competition laws. Apple was fined $571 million for failing to comply with "anti-steering" obligations under the Digital Markets Act, which requires the company to allow developers to inform customers about alternative offers outside its App Store. Meta received a $228 million fine for illegally requiring users to consent to sharing their data or pay for an ad-free service, a practice introduced with the launch of paid subscriptions for Facebook and Instagram in November 2023.</p>

          <p>A hidden religious divide is emerging in American politics, particularly within Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, fueled by young, conservative men seeking community and answers online. These converts often disillusioned with modernity and embracing traditionalist views, are entering religious communities historically associated with specific ethnic groups. This influx is creating tensions between "cradle" members and "convert" members, potentially accelerating the political polarization of American religion, challenging the authority and traditions within these faiths, and remaking them in their idealized, ideological image.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that almost half of Americans are exposed to unsafe levels of air pollutants, a rise compared to the previous year. The ALA report also indicates that a person of color is more than twice as likely as a white American to live in a neighborhood with unhealthy levels of smog and soot. Soot and smog can cause premature death and increase the risk of an array of serious medical conditions such as asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes, preterm births and impaired cognitive functioning in later life.</p>
