Yu, who was a vocal proponent of traditional Chinese medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, previously worked as a journalist and held various positions within the administration before being promoted to director in 2018, he was then replaced in 2023.

          <p>Following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for Iran to return to the negotiating table. Starmer emphasized the importance of regional stability, describing Iran's nuclear program as a grave threat to international security. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds echoed this sentiment, advocating for de-escalation and diplomatic solutions, but Israel's President Isaac Herzog indicated that Iran's nuclear program has been hit "substantially" by the US attacks and prior Israeli strikes. Iran's ambassador to the UK condemned the US strikes as "outrageous," while the UN Secretary-General warned of a dangerous escalation.</p>

Ishiba emphasized the need for de-escalation and blocking Iran's nuclear development.

While refraining from expressing immediate support for the US military action, Ishiba indicated that Japan would make a decision after internal government discussions.</p>

          <p>Ali Khamenei's leadership in Iran is increasingly vulnerable following the American destruction of the Fordow nuclear facility, which has weakened his security pillars, the IRGC and intelligence services. Khamenei's intransigence is seen as a major factor in the American bombing. Experts suggest that this could be the beginning of the end for the regime, but the aftermath remains uncertain, with possibilities ranging from revolution to an internal coup or military dictatorship. The article explores potential successors and the possibility of a national unity government, while also considering the risk of anarchy or civil war.</p>

          <p>Voting is currently taking place in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, viewed as an indicator for the upcoming House of Councillors race. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party is aiming to maintain its seats despite low approval ratings. The election features a high number of candidates, and key issues include support for households grappling with inflation and political funding scandals. Voter turnout is slightly higher compared to the previous election, with a significant number of people casting early ballots.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the murder of her husband, Bob, was overturned after she spent nearly two decades in prison. New evidence, including DNA testing, revealed that some blood evidence used against her at trial was either not blood or did not belong to her husband. Loyola Project for the Innocent helped uncover these inconsistencies, leading to the overturning of her conviction. Although she was temporarily released due to COVID-19 concerns, the district attorney initially sought to retry her before eventually dropping the charges, she is now working to rebuild her life.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Explore Spleen's Role in Diabetes Treatment</h2>

          <p>Two Chinese studies suggest that the spleen could be transformed into a hub for treating diabetes through cell transplantation. Researchers at Nanjing University found that shielding islet cells could improve their survival after being transplanted into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. They also found that nanoparticles could help engineer the spleen into a more promising long-term survival site compared to the liver. The scientists believe that the spleen could be an ideal organ for islet transplantation if systematic clinical studies demonstrate its safety and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Stephanie Fagan and Jessica Pelley, separated by tragedy, reunited after 20 years through Facebook. The Pelley family murders in 1989 led to Jessica's relocation and loss of contact with friends, including Stephanie. Stephanie, who never forgot Jessica, regularly visited and cleaned the Pelley family graves, hoping to reconnect. The two women, who were witnesses in the trial of Jessica's stepbrother for the murders, finally reconnected in 2009 and now consider each other sisters.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the US carried out a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, claiming they have been "obliterated." Israel stated that they were in "full co-ordination" with the US in planning the strikes. Iranian officials confirmed the attacks but denied suffering a major blow. The strikes, a significant escalation in the conflict between Iran and Israel, targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, and the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization said the bombing was a "barbaric violation" of international law.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to authorize US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities represents a significant gamble, predicated on the belief that the targeted sites have been completely destroyed and that Iran will lack the capacity or resolve to retaliate effectively. Trump hopes that moderate elements within the Iranian regime will recognize their strategic setback and pursue dialogue. However, if Iran manages to inflict damage on US assets or personnel, the situation could escalate rapidly, and the President has bet that his supporters will be with him on this.</p>
