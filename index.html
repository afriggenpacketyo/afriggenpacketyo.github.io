          <p>The article discusses the memorialization of Charlie Kirk, a controversial far-right podcaster, by powerful institutions. It argues that these memorials seek to enshrine Kirk into the national consciousness and coalesce the state into his movement. The author draws parallels to Confederate memorials, suggesting that these tributes elevate hard-right extremism above public questioning. The article critiques calls for unity that ignore Kirk's divisive rhetoric and the harm it caused to marginalized communities. The optimism score for this article is 25.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plans to place $100,000 fees on H-1B visa applications will disproportionately harm America's startup space, according to founders and venture capitalists. H-1B visas allow companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in skilled occupations, but were already difficult to secure for startups. Experts argue that the new fee will complicate recruitment strategies and could lead to a reduction in entrepreneurship and venture capital funding. The new fee could instead create a stronger case for investors to deploy capital into markets such as the U.K., Canada and Europe. The optimism score for this article is 50.</p>
