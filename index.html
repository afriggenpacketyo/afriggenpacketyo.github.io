          <p>Jacob Henriques, an assistant admissions director at Emmanuel College in Boston, was arrested on charges of attempted sex trafficking of a minor. Henriques allegedly used his position to access personal information of potential students and contacted them with offers to pay them for "some fun," sending them pornography, and making inappropriate requests. One 17-year-old prospective student reported that Henriques offered her $400 and continued to text her despite her rejections, even offering to buy her anything she wanted. Emmanuel College has since fired Henriques and is cooperating with the FBI's investigation to identify other potential victims.</p>

          <p>Numerous data-gathering programs that monitor deaths and diseases in the United States have been eliminated due to layoffs and proposed budget cuts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reportedly terminated experts tracking abortions, pregnancies, job-related injuries, lead poisonings, sexual violence, and youth smoking. Health experts express concern that these cuts will hinder the nation's ability to understand and address health issues effectively. While the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics remains largely intact, programs like the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System and the Environmental Public Health Tracking Program have been significantly impacted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ+ health, impacting research on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. Officials claim the cuts align with agency priorities, deeming some research "unscientific" due to its focus on gender identity and equity objectives. Critics argue that the cuts harm vulnerable populations and create a hierarchy of patients, while the administration defends its move as a correction of ideological bias. The cuts affect studies on antibiotic resistance, autism, and cancer, leading to staff firings and jeopardizing clinical trials, potentially undermining efforts to combat HIV and other illnesses within the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders in Congress have actively worked to protect President Trump's tariffs despite growing concerns about their impact on the U.S. economy. A Senate resolution aimed at repealing the tariffs was blocked through a White House veto threat and House parliamentary tactics. While Democrats criticized the tariffs for contributing to economic contraction and predicting job losses, Republicans defended them as a necessary strategy for renegotiating trade policies. The debate unfolded against a backdrop of mixed economic data, with a contraction in GDP contrasted by positive employment figures.</p>

          <p>Canadians are increasingly worried about the possibility of war with the U.S. due to President Trump's rhetoric and trade policies, which are viewed as a prelude to appropriating Canada as the 51st state. The country's close integration with the U.S. and reliance on American sanity have left it vulnerable, prompting concerns about a potential military threat. Experts suggest that any conflict would likely involve insurgent warfare across both countries, and that Canada's educated population and vast wilderness would pose unique challenges to an occupying force. While the idea of such a conflict remains largely unthinkable, it is becoming less so as relations between the two nations deteriorate.</p>

          <p>Autonomous vehicles promise to be much safer than human drivers, who are prone to distractions, fatigue, anger, and impairment, leading to millions of road crash deaths globally each year. A Waymo study comparing its self-driving cars' performance over 56.7 million miles to human drivers found an 81% reduction in airbag-deploying crashes and an 85% reduction in crashes with serious injuries. The study suggests that widespread adoption of self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives annually, although challenges remain in expanding the technology to diverse conditions and addressing public apprehension.</p>

          <p>The US economy faces instability due to President Trump's chaotic policies, marked by uncertainty and wariness among businesses and consumers. While recent data shows a strong payroll report, forward-looking surveys reveal anxiety, with the Michigan consumer sentiment index experiencing its steepest decline since the 1990 recession. Ambiguity surrounding tariff policies, budget cuts, and immigration measures contribute to this uncertainty, causing businesses and consumers to hesitate on investment and spending decisions.

          <p>President Trump's policies indirectly influenced the Australian election, contributing to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election. Voters were wary of Mr. Dutton, who was likened to Mr. Trump, and they were concerned about economic instability and the cost of living, which were impacted by Trump's trade policies. While Albanese did not directly campaign against Trump, the global tumult caused by his policies made him a factor in the election. The result demonstrates a rejection of Trump-style politics and a preference for sensible, centrist policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump is jeopardizing America's security by damaging relationships with Canada and Mexico, its two closest neighbors and largest trading partners. His rhetoric and policies, including threatening war with Canada and considering military intervention in Mexico, are alienating these nations and undermining the strategic advantage of having secure borders and friendly neighbors. The author argues that Trump's actions are reckless and could lead to dire consequences, such as the withdrawal of Canada from the North Warning System and a destabilizing conflict along the southern border.</p>

          <p>Native American women, particularly from south-eastern Indigenous nations, are reclaiming the tradition of facial tattoos as a form of cultural revitalization and personal commitment. The Inchunwa Project, a community collective, supports this movement through research, education, and tattooing sessions. The practice, which was once common but faded due to colonization, now represents a connection to ancestors, a commitment to community, and a pathway for future generations. The traditional process differs from western tattooing, often involving hand-poked designs without stencils, emphasizing a deeper connection between the tattooer and the person receiving the tattoo.</p>
