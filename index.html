            <p>Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil are challenging the government's attempt to deport him, arguing that the justification provided by Secretary of State Marco Rubio lacks evidence. Rubio asserts that Khalil's presence in the U.S. poses a foreign policy risk due to his alleged role in antisemitic protests. Khalil's attorneys plan to depose Rubio to understand the basis for his determination, claiming it infringes on First Amendment rights. The immigration judge will decide on Khalil's removability, potentially setting a precedent for silencing critics.</p>

            <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), a state-owned nuclear conglomerate, is facing criticism for boasting about receiving nearly 1.2 million applications for 8,000 positions. The announcement was perceived as insensitive to the challenges faced by young jobseekers in a competitive market. Critics argue that CNNC's self-promotion is tone-deaf and disregards the difficulties faced by graduates seeking employment.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has upheld a judge's order requiring the Trump administration to facilitate the return to the United States of a Salvadoran man who the government has acknowledged was deported in error to El Salvador. The court said that the judge's order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent". The justices directed Xinis to clarify the directive “with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”.</p>
