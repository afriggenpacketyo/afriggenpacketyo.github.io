          <p>Approximately 1,000 emergency personnel are battling significant wildfires across eastern Germany, particularly in the regions of Saxony and Thuringia. The fires, exacerbated by a recent heatwave, cover an estimated 1,000 hectares and have prompted disaster alerts and evacuations in several communities. The situation in Saxony is especially dangerous as the fire is detonating old munitions buried in the ground from a former military training area. Authorities have warned that the risk of further forest fires will remain high throughout the weekend.</p>

          <p>Australia's immigration minister has confirmed that the entry visa for the American rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, was revoked due to his pro-Nazi song. The government decided to cancel the visa after he released a track containing the phrase "Heil Hitler" and a sample from a Hitler speech. The minister stated that while every application is reassessed, the country does not need to import such bigotry. This action follows a history of antisemitic remarks from Ye, who is married to an Australian citizen.</p>

          <p>The Welsh women's national football team is preparing for its first-ever appearance at the European Championship, Euro 2025. As the lowest-ranked debutants facing a tough group, the team is relying on strong unity and a deep connection to their Welsh heritage. Coach Rhian Wilkinson emphasizes this "Welsh red vein" and sisterhood as key strengths for a squad with less depth than larger nations. The tournament is seen as a major opportunity to increase visibility and inspire a new generation of female players in Wales.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has called for stricter regulations on "blind box" toys, a marketing model that has been central to the success of companies like Pop Mart. An editorial raised concerns about businesses enticing children to spend heavily on these mystery collectibles. However, analysts believe Pop Mart may be insulated from a major crackdown, as its primary consumers are young adults, not children, and the company is experiencing rapid overseas growth. This scrutiny is reminiscent of past regulatory actions against China's video game industry.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network believe that pieces of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor lit up the night sky over the Scottish Highlands and was captured on numerous doorbell cameras, with local residents reporting an orange glow and a loud bang. The network, which has calculated the object's trajectory from the asteroid belt, is appealing to hillwalkers in the area to keep an eye out for the rare space rocks.

          <p>One year after a decisive election win, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is facing a tumultuous period marked by unfulfilled economic promises and plummeting popularity. The government has struggled with high inflation and muted economic growth, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves has overseen a series of policy U-turns, notably on welfare reform. This has created a difficult political landscape for Labour, which is also contending with the rising popularity of the rival Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, which has gained favor with disaffected voters.</p>
