          <p>Following the Alabama Crimson Tide's upset loss to Florida State, which snapped a 23-game season-opener winning streak, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith commented on the team's trajectory. Smith suggested on social media that the era of Nick Saban's dominance at Alabama is over, pointing to issues like sacks surrendered, dropped passes, and quarterback limitations. The article notes that this is the team's first season under new coach Kalen DeBoer, who replaced the retired Saban. Smith's analysis reflects growing questions about whether the college football powerhouse can maintain its long-standing success without its legendary coach.</p>

          <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin recounts her journey of finding love and reinventing her life after the sudden death of her first husband when she was 26. Initially believing she wouldn't remarry, she later reconnected with and married Steve Hasty, who encouraged her to pursue new, ambitious dreams. This support led her to transition from a traditional therapy practice to a successful career as a full-time author and speaker. Together, they embraced a complete lifestyle change, now living on a sailboat in the Florida Keys, a life she had never previously imagined for herself.</p>

          <p>The US Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing. This substantial prize ranks as the fifth-largest in the history of the game, continuing a winless streak that began on May 31. Winners have the option to receive the full amount in payments spread over 30 years or choose a lump-sum cash option of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. Despite the astronomical odds of winning, which stand at 1 in 292.2 million, the massive jackpot continues to attract widespread participation across 45 states.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details recent advancements in chronic pain research that focus on the brain as a primary source. The article highlights a shift towards "reverse translational research," which starts with a patient's real-world experience to identify objective biomarkers for subjective pain. This approach has enabled scientists to map the unique neural signatures of pain and even use deep brain stimulation to predict and interrupt pain signals before they intensify. While not yet widely available, these innovations demonstrate that pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, offering hope for future non-surgical therapies.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: New Multipolar Arms Race Elevates Global Ballistic Missile Threat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the world is entering a new and dangerous multipolar arms race, significantly increasing the threat posed by advanced ballistic missile capabilities. The author contends that, similar to the Cold War, adversaries can now hold entire populations hostage under the threat of nuclear conflict, with the risk of accidental war being non-insignificant. While acknowledging that the long period of relative peace since World War II may have been an exception in human history, the article suggests the current trajectory toward perpetual conflict is not inevitable.

          <p>A poignant project by CBS News' Steve Hartman and photographer Lou Bopp documents the bedrooms of children who were victims of school shootings, left untouched by their grieving families. The article shares the perspectives of both the reporter and the photographer on the profound emotional challenge of capturing a "portrait of a person who's not there." By preserving these spaces—filled with personal items and memories—the families hope to convey the depth of their loss and humanize the statistics of gun violence. The images serve as a powerful and heartbreaking testament to the lives cut short.</p>

Experts and legal scholars express concern that these actions could politicize the central bank, undermining its long-held independence and threatening the stability of the American financial system. While the administration frames its moves as necessary reform, critics warn of potential long-term economic damage, such as hyperinflation, if the Fed loses its credibility to set monetary policy free from political pressure.

          <p>The recent release of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview transcripts by the Justice Department has drawn criticism for what many see as a failure to pursue significant leads. During the interview, Maxwell hinted that associates of Jeffrey Epstein were serving in President Trump's cabinet, but Deputy US Attorney Todd Blanche did not press her for names. Critics, including former federal prosecutors and victims' attorneys, argue that the questioning was superficial and allowed Maxwell to evade substantive answers about powerful individuals connected to Epstein. This has fueled perceptions that the disclosures are more performative than a genuine effort to uncover the full extent of the criminal network.</p>

The piece also references his misunderstanding of how tariffs work and his claim that rising sea levels would create more oceanfront property.

          <p>An exhibition at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History is highlighting the little-known story of how surfing was introduced to the U.S. mainland. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—were studying at a military school near Santa Cruz. They fashioned surfboards from local redwood, replicating the koa and ulu boards they used at home, and demonstrated the royal sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their exhibition of "surfboard swimming" was documented in a local newspaper and inspired locals to take up the activity, planting the seeds for the sport's future popularity in America.</p>

The warnings came after U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated he expects such collaboration to move forward following his visit to Taipei. For decades, the U.S. has sold arms to the self-governing island, but co-production would mark a significant escalation in defense ties. Chinese observers note that while both Washington and Taipei see strategic and industrial benefits, such a move would be viewed by Beijing as a major provocation.</p>

Driven by tight state budgets and concerns over housing affordability, these surcharges aim to generate revenue from wealthy, often part-time, residents. However, the policy has sparked backlash from real estate brokers and homeowners, who argue it unfairly penalizes individuals who contribute significantly to local economies without heavily using municipal services.

The iconic packets, a staple in sushi takeaways, are used for mere seconds but can persist in the environment for centuries. Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process effectively. This ban builds on previous legislation targeting plastic bags and straws, aiming to protect marine life and reduce pollution, as officials warn the flow of plastic into oceans could otherwise triple by 2040.</p>

Katz, who came of age during the abstract expressionism movement, stayed true to his own brand of realism, with Ada as his central subject. Curators note his interest is less in emotional depth and more in style, fashion, and the interplay of light and form, creating detached portraits that he says act like a mirror, allowing viewers to see themselves.</p>

Concurrently, companies like SpaceX are challenging the agency's constitutionality in court.

          <p>This essay addresses the common feeling of guilt or misery experienced when personal success coincides with widespread global suffering. The author draws on ancient philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, where one member's pain is felt by all. However, the piece argues that this concept also implies a shared experience of joy, a concept known as "mudita" or sympathetic joy. It suggests that to avoid cynicism or depression, individuals should allow themselves to feel both the world's pain and its joys, recognizing that embracing moments of happiness is a form of resistance against despair.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to reform the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), raising concerns among public health experts. The VICP was established to provide a no-fault compensation system for rare vaccine side effects and to stabilize the vaccine market by protecting manufacturers from extensive litigation. Critics fear that Kennedy, a long-time vaccine skeptic, could dismantle the program, potentially exposing manufacturers to lawsuits that could lead them to exit the market and reduce vaccine availability. Changes could also make it harder for individuals with legitimate vaccine injuries to receive financial assistance.</p>

          <p>The IRS has provided guidance clarifying how consumers can still qualify for the federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, even if they don't take possession of the vehicle by the September 30 cutoff date. According to the new document, a taxpayer is eligible if they enter into a "written binding contract" to purchase an electric vehicle and make a payment on or before the deadline. This allows buyers to order a vehicle, sign a contract, and put down a deposit before the program expires, and still claim the credit when the car is delivered later. (not investment advice)</p>

For music, he highlights the work of Craig Finn, both with his band The Hold Steady and his solo projects, for capturing the 21st-century American experience.

          <p>President Trump's highly publicized crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., is encountering significant resistance within the federal court system. In the past month, grand juries have refused to indict in at least five cases brought by federal prosecutors against residents for allegedly assaulting federal officers. Judges have also expressed frustration with prosecutors over sloppy cases and procedural delays, questioning the strength of the charges being filed. This judicial pushback suggests that despite a surge in arrests, the administration's effort to secure convictions and justify its heavy law-enforcement presence in the capital is struggling to hold up under legal scrutiny.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece, written by a former National Guard combat engineer, argues that the increasing use of the Guard for domestic law enforcement and to fill civilian roles is a dangerous trend. The author contends that deploying troops for immigration enforcement, crime suppression, or as substitute teachers blurs the line between military and civilian authority, eroding public trust. This misuse not only undermines the Guard's intended purpose as a last-resort disaster response force but also strains a military already stretched thin by overseas deployments. The article calls on governors to resist such deployments to preserve the Guard's legitimacy and protect American democracy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively dismantling the public health infrastructure surrounding COVID-19 vaccines, a stark reversal from the first term's Operation Warp Speed initiative. Led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine skeptic, the administration is canceling grants for mRNA vaccine development and has replaced expert advisory committees with critics. Furthermore, by removing COVID-19 shots from the list of recommended vaccines for children and pregnant women, insurance coverage is likely to be eliminated. This policy shift is sowing public doubt about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, which were previously touted as a "medical miracle."</p>

          <p>Despite public awareness campaigns and warnings, taking high-risk selfies, or "killfies," continues to be a deadly trend, with India accounting for a disproportionate number of incidents. Recent analyses of news reports show India had 271 cases of selfie-related injury or death since 2014, representing 42% of the global total. The most common danger zones involve heights like cliffs and waterfalls, and the majority of victims are men. The problem is compounded when bystanders attempt rescues and also lose their lives, turning one person's risky behavior into a wider tragedy, highlighting the powerful and sometimes fatal pursuit of online validation.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced that her party, if elected, would remove all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea to focus solely on maximizing fossil fuel extraction. This marks a significant shift in climate policy, reversing the UK's legally binding commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Badenoch argued it was "absurd" to leave resources untapped while other nations extract them. The Labour government criticized the plan, stating it would not lower energy bills, would harm energy security, and would accelerate the climate crisis, reaffirming their commitment to a managed transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

This tragic event underscores government warnings about declining vaccination rates, with none of the main childhood vaccines in England meeting the 95% uptake target required for herd immunity. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for protecting newborns in their first weeks of life, as 27 of the 33 infant deaths from the illness since 2013 involved unvaccinated mothers.</p>

          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has led to significant shortages and price hikes, even in its home country of Japan. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, jumped 170% at a recent auction, and retailers have doubled their prices over the last year. Japan's aging farming community is struggling to keep up with the labor-intensive cultivation process, prompting the government to consider subsidies. Major companies like Ito En are creating dedicated divisions to manage the supply chain bottleneck, while some cafes are educating consumers on using different grades of matcha.</p>

While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains below pre-COVID levels.

A new generation of leaders like Gavin Newsom and J.B. Pritzker are emerging as vocal opponents, and polls show a slight Democratic lead for congressional races.

          <p>This essay draws on a 1995 speech by Toni Morrison to argue that the historical struggle of Black Americans offers crucial lessons for combating the rise of fascism today. Morrison identified fascism not as a sudden leap but as a series of steps, including inventing an enemy and criminalizing them, a process she called the "succubus twin" of racism. The author contends that Black history is a story of resisting this racial fascism through unwavering belief in democratic ideals, diverse methods of resistance, and profound faith. This legacy provides a powerful model for confronting current authoritarian threats, urging a fight that is both political and cultural.</p>
