          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has kept its base rate steady at 4.75%, mirroring the Federal Reserve's decision to hold its target range at 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that there was no urgency to alter US monetary policy, emphasizing the need to monitor data for any inflationary effects from tariffs. This decision marks the third consecutive meeting where the Fed has maintained its interest rate, despite ongoing pressure from President Trump to implement cuts to ease economic funding costs. The Fed's independent monetary policy continues to be a focal point amid trade war dynamics.</p>

          <p>A US judge in Boston has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing a violation of due process rights. The order came after reports that the US military was preparing to fly migrants to Libya, a country mired in conflict and deemed unsafe by the US State Department. Judge Brian Murphy stated that the deportations would defy a previous injunction protecting migrants' rights to written notice and an opportunity to file claims against removal. This decision follows increasing scrutiny of the administration's immigration policies and tactics, including potential deportations to other countries like Rwanda and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Top advisors, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented President Trump with a plan to establish a U.S. sovereign wealth fund, a concept the president had requested earlier in the year.

The fund, intended to invest assets and generate returns for public benefit, has been considered as a potential means to own a stake in companies like TikTok.

The protesters had stormed Butler Library, occupying one of the rooms and vandalizing property, prompting a response from the university's security team. The university is asking protesters to show their IDs and disperse, warning that failure to comply may result in arrests. This incident is taking place during the school's pre-final exams reading week. The school has been under increased scrutiny from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas has experienced its wettest May on record after a persistent storm system brought rain to the city for four consecutive days, an unusual occurrence for this time of year. The heavy rains led to flash flooding in the area, including on the Las Vegas Strip, and resulted in one person being swept away by floodwaters in Henderson. The rare weather event comes as scientists warn that climate change is intensifying extreme weather conditions. The storm system is now moving out of the region, with drier and warmer weather expected in the coming days.</p>

          <p>In an Arizona court, an AI-generated version of a deceased man addressed his killer during sentencing, a move praised by some and criticized by others. Chris Pelkey's family used AI technology to recreate him using voice recordings, videos, and pictures, allowing him to deliver a victim impact statement. The judge appreciated the use of AI, and sentenced the killer to ten and a half years in prison. While supporters believe this is a step into the future, others worry about the ethical implications and potential misuse of AI in legal cases.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates unchanged, amidst President Trump's pressure to lower borrowing costs. Concerns that Mr. Trump's tariffs could spur both higher inflation and unemployment were highlighted by Fed chair Jerome Powell. At the benchmark rate's current level, the Fed has the flexibility to cut rates if unemployment rises, or hike rates if inflation reignites due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, he noted. Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk that the U.S. economy could slide into stagflation.</p>

The proposed rule, which would have restricted exports of advanced AI chips to certain countries, was set to take effect on May 15. The Department of Commerce confirmed the plan, stating that the existing rule is overly complex and would stifle American innovation. AMD CEO Lisa Su has emphasized the importance of balancing national security concerns with maintaining access to chips to boost the American chip industry.</p>
