          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has retired its entire "Glossary of Extremism and Hate" after facing significant criticism for including the conservative group Turning Point USA (TPUSA). The move came after public figures, including Elon Musk, and Republican lawmakers condemned the listing, particularly following the recent assassination of TPUSA co-founder Charlie Kirk. The ADL stated the decision was part of a strategy review to present its research more effectively, acknowledging some entries were outdated. The glossary, which included groups like the Proud Boys and Nation of Islam but omitted others like Antifa, is being retired to allow the organization to explore new approaches in its mission to combat antisemitism and hate.</p>

          <p>A frantic rescue operation is ongoing in Java, Indonesia, where more than 90 students, mostly boys aged 12 to 18, are believed to be trapped under the rubble of a collapsed Islamic boarding school. The multi-story building gave way during the illegal construction of additional floors while students were gathered for afternoon prayers. So far, three deaths have been confirmed and over 100 people are injured, with officials racing against time to find survivors. Rescue workers have detected signs of life from at least six children, but the unstable debris is complicating their efforts to reach those still trapped.</p>

          <p>Emma Hayes, the head coach of the United States women's national soccer team, has been inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. Reflecting on her transition from club to international management, Hayes described the new role as being "like becoming a grandparent," where she enjoys focused time with players before returning them to their clubs. The former Chelsea manager, who led the US to an Olympic gold medal shortly after taking the position, noted that the change has allowed her to apply more strategic, long-term thinking. She expressed great satisfaction with her new role and the opportunity to work with a nation that has been significant in her professional development.</p>

          <p>A significant sunscreen scandal in Australia has expanded, with 18 products now recalled over concerns they do not provide their claimed level of sun protection. The issue began when a consumer group's analysis found discrepancies, including one SPF 50+ product that tested as low as SPF 4. An investigation by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has since identified issues with a shared base formula and raised "significant concerns" about a U.S.-based testing laboratory. The scandal has prompted a major public backlash in a country with the world's highest skin cancer rates and may have global implications for product testing and manufacturing standards.</p>

The event has deeply traumatized the region, which was already recovering from a recent deadly tropical storm, compounding the humanitarian challenge for local authorities and residents.</p>

          <p>The United States federal government has officially shut down after Congress failed to pass a spending bill to continue funding its operations. The impasse stems from a dispute between the Republican-controlled Congress and Democrats, primarily over healthcare policy, with Democrats refusing to support a bill without extensions for health insurance subsidies. This marks the first shutdown in nearly seven years, a situation that occurs when the legislative and executive branches cannot agree on a budget. President Trump has indicated a willingness to endure a prolonged shutdown, suggesting it could be used to permanently reduce the size of the federal workforce and cut programs.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced his intention to change how international laws, particularly Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, are interpreted in asylum cases. The goal is to prevent unsuccessful asylum seekers and foreign criminals from blocking their deportation by claiming they would face inferior prison or healthcare systems in their home countries. Starmer argued that while genuine refugees should be protected, the current application of these laws needs to adapt to the reality of modern mass migration. He clarified that the aim is not to "tear down" human rights conventions but to adjust their interpretation by UK courts to better address contemporary challenges.</p>

          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025 alone, highlighting the sport's rapid financial growth, primarily concentrated in leagues in England and the United States. While rising fees indicate a healthier economic ecosystem, experts express concern that this trend is widening the financial gap between elite clubs and the rest of the world. Leagues like Germany's Bundesliga are struggling to compete with the broadcast and sponsorship revenues of their English and American counterparts. This financial disparity risks creating a permanent elite tier, potentially leaving many clubs and leagues behind as the sport's commercialization accelerates.</p>

          <p>A new Gaza peace framework proposed by President Donald Trump has garnered significant international momentum, receiving support from key Arab nations and a public endorsement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The plan outlines a phased end to the war and reconstruction, with a vague pathway toward eventual Palestinian statehood. However, its primary weakness lies in a lack of specific details, which could allow for conflicting interpretations and potential sabotage during negotiations. While Netanyahu publicly supported the plan alongside Trump, he later reassured his domestic audience in Hebrew that he remains staunchly opposed to a Palestinian state, highlighting the fragile and ambiguous nature of the agreement.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are meeting in Copenhagen under heightened security to discuss bolstering continental defense, spurred by recent Russian airspace incursions and drone disruptions at Danish airports. A key proposal on the agenda is the creation of a multi-layered "drone wall" along the EU's eastern flank to detect and neutralize Russian drones, a plan already backed by ten member states. The summit's urgency is underscored by recent drone activity over Denmark, Germany, Lithuania, and Norway, which has been widely attributed to Russia. Leaders are aiming to develop a roadmap for a "2030-ready" defense posture, focusing on joint procurement and developing advanced military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's inclusion in a U.S.-led committee to oversee Gaza has sparked controversy and skepticism among Palestinians and within his own Labour Party. Blair, who previously served as a Middle East envoy from 2007 to 2015 with little success, is viewed by many Palestinians as biased towards Israel, and his reputation remains tarnished by his support for the 2003 Iraq invasion. While supporters argue his connections with the U.S., Israel, and Gulf states make him a viable mediator, critics, including Hamas officials, have rejected any role for him. The proposed appointment highlights the deep-seated challenges of finding a figure acceptable to all parties in the long-standing conflict.</p>

          <p>A BBC journalist working undercover as a cleaner at the Castlehill care home in Inverness, Scotland, has exposed distressing scenes of neglect and inadequate care. The investigation, prompted by a family's secret camera footage, found an understaffed facility where residents' basic needs were often unmet, leading to a loss of dignity and significant distress. The reporter witnessed residents left in soiled clothes for hours, a lack of meaningful human interaction, and crisis situations arising from an improper staff mix to handle dementia care. The home, which charges up to £1,800 per week, had the most upheld complaints in Scotland for 2024, highlighting a systemic crisis in the care sector.</p>

          <p>A doctor evacuated from Gaza has provided a harrowing account of the dire conditions facing medical professionals, who are starving while trying to save lives. Dr. Mohammed Abu Mughaisib of Médecins Sans Frontières described how he and his colleagues were forced to sip glucose solution for energy and how the constant topic of conversation became the desperate search for food. He detailed a collapsed healthcare system where patients lie on the floor due to a lack of beds and doctors in intensive care units must wait for one patient to die to admit another. The medic emphasized that the war has destroyed every layer of life, leaving civilians and medical staff in a state of constant fear and deprivation.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of highly skilled foreign professionals on H-1B work visas are choosing to leave the United States, citing the anxiety and instability associated with the country's immigration system. The article profiles a former vice president at a global firm who left for Portugal after feeling like a "second-class citizen" whose entire life was precariously tied to her employment status. Her experience reflects a broader trend of disillusionment among international talent, who are now looking to countries with more welcoming visa policies. This exodus of skilled workers raises questions about whether the U.S. is losing its appeal as a top destination for global talent.</p>

          <p>A civilian employee of the U.S. Navy has been charged after allegedly fabricating an active shooter threat at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. The false report triggered a base-wide lockdown and a massive emergency response. According to the criminal complaint, the employee, Malika Brittingham, admitted to carrying out the hoax. She reportedly explained to investigators that she felt ostracized by her colleagues and hoped that the shared traumatic experience of an active shooter situation would help them "trauma bond." The interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey condemned the act, vowing that such fear-mongering would not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) posted a banner on its official homepage blaming the "Radical Left" for the government shutdown, a move that an ethics watchdog group has called a "blatant violation" of federal law. The message claimed Democrats were inflicting "massive pain on the American people" to secure their policy demands. The nonprofit group Public Citizen filed a formal complaint, arguing that the highly partisan language on a government website violates the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities. This incident highlights the intensely politicized nature of the shutdown and raises questions about the use of government resources for partisan messaging.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers began their postseason campaign with a dominant 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the wild-card series. The offense was explosive, matching a franchise playoff record with five home runs, including two each from stars Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Starting pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance over seven innings, keeping the Reds' bats quiet for most of the night. However, the team's persistent bullpen issues resurfaced late in the game, as three relievers walked four batters and allowed three runs in the eighth inning, turning a blowout into a tense situation and raising concerns for later rounds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown will have a direct financial impact on the military, as all active-duty service members are required to continue working without receiving their pay until the funding impasse is resolved.

A bill that would have ensured troops get paid during a shutdown did not pass in time, leaving service members and their families facing financial uncertainty.

          <p>While the U.S. government shutdown is not expected to halt the broader mortgage market, it could cause delays for homebuyers seeking government-backed loans. Conventional mortgages from private lenders should proceed normally, but applications for loans insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA may face processing slowdowns due to staff furloughs. The USDA will completely halt the issuance of new home loans for rural buyers during the shutdown. Additionally, borrowers in flood zones may face complications, as the National Flood Insurance Program cannot issue new or renewal policies, potentially stalling closings for some homebuyers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is not expected to affect the requirement for borrowers to make payments on their federal student loans. According to the Department of Education's contingency plan, loan servicing will continue, and payments will remain due. However, with the vast majority of the department's staff furloughed, borrowers may face significant delays if they need assistance or encounter issues with their loan servicers. While disbursements for existing aid like Pell Grants are expected to continue, the processing of loan forgiveness applications could be impacted by the staffing shortages if the shutdown persists for an extended period.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing careers in the skilled trades, such as electricians and plumbers, over traditional white-collar paths. This shift is driven by concerns over substantial student loan debt and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating entry-level office jobs. A recent survey found that over half of Gen Z is worried about college costs, and 77% prioritize jobs that are difficult to automate. As a result, professions in the trades are losing their former stigma and are now seen as providing a secure and potentially lucrative career path, with some young entrepreneurs finding significant financial success without a college degree.</p>

          <p>A prolonged U.S. government shutdown could lead to significant disruptions for air travelers, according to industry experts. While essential employees like TSA officers and air traffic controllers are required to work, they will not be paid, which could lead to increased sick calls and staff shortages as seen in past shutdowns. This could result in longer security lines, flight delays, and cancellations across the country. The U.S. Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the travel economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, exacerbating an existing nationwide shortage and threatening the stability of the aviation system.</p>
