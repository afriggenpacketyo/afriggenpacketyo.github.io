        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) projects the UK will face the highest inflation rate among G7 advanced economies in 2025, reaching 3.5% primarily due to rising food prices. Although the UK's growth forecast for this year saw a slight increase to 1.4%, a deceleration to 1% is expected in 2026, influenced by stricter fiscal measures, increased trade costs, and prevailing uncertainties. This economic outlook comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares a Budget likely to involve tax increases or spending cuts to meet borrowing rules. The Bank of England has also warned the UK is not yet "out of the woods" regarding inflation, which currently stands at 3.8%. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has publicly detailed crimes against humanity charges against former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, accusing him of involvement in the killings of at least 76 individuals. These alleged acts occurred during his time as Davao City mayor (2013-2016) and later as president (2016-2018), with prosecutors claiming he authorized and instructed violence against alleged drug criminals. Duterte, who previously denied authorizing extrajudicial killings, was arrested in March and is held at an ICC facility in the Netherlands. A scheduled court hearing was postponed as his attorneys argue he is not fit for trial, sparking criticism from his supporters against the current Philippine administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen labeled the recent drone incursion that halted flights at Copenhagen airport as the nation's "most severe attack on infrastructure," suggesting potential Russian involvement. This incident is viewed within a broader pattern of escalating Russian incursions into NATO airspace, including recent events in Poland, Romania, and Estonia. Danish intelligence also warned of a "high threat of sabotage," indicating an intent to disrupt and test boundaries rather than a direct attack. The closure impacted around 20,000 passengers, prompting police to describe the operators as a "capable actor" and NATO to reinforce its eastern defenses in response to these perceived threats.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs are urging a federal judge to sentence him to no more than 14 months, arguing his career and reputation are already destroyed after nearly 13 months in prison. The defense detailed harsh conditions, including constant suicide watch, limited clean water, and a painful knee injury, while noting his newfound sobriety and efforts to teach inmates. Combs was acquitted of serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges, with his legal team emphasizing the jury's message of innocence on those counts. However, prosecutors intend to recommend a significantly longer sentence, maintaining that Combs's conduct warrants further imprisonment.</p>

Authorities warn of a "catastrophic" situation, with the typhoon expected to impact northern Vietnam next. Scientists note that a warming climate is likely to make tropical storms more intense, increasing risks of severe winds, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the American Association of Professors indicates that one in four professors in US Southern states, notably Florida, South Carolina, and Texas, are contemplating or actively pursuing opportunities elsewhere. The prevailing political climate, characterized by heightened government scrutiny over higher education and the implementation of bans on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, is identified as the primary catalyst for this trend. Many academics, including former University of Texas professor Heather Houser, cite concerns about academic freedom and the ability to teach sensitive topics. This movement highlights a growing sense of "fear, frustration, and hopelessness" among faculty, impacting the intellectual environment of these institutions.</p>

          <p>An article critically analyzes the widespread posthumous memorialization of Charlie Kirk, a far-right podcaster, arguing it serves to rebrand his divisive, extremist views as nationally heroic. The author expresses dismay over gestures like the White House ordering flags at half-staff and NFL in-game tributes, drawing parallels to historical Confederate memorials that sought to legitimize controversial ideologies. This commentary suggests such actions are a deliberate attempt by powerful institutions to elevate Kirk's hostile rhetoric beyond reproach, effectively coalescing the state into his movement.

          <p>Cornelius Taylor was tragically killed when a front loader cleared his homeless encampment in Atlanta, an event his family and advocates link to a national trend of criminalizing homelessness.

          <p>An analysis outlines a potential path for America to devolve into "competitive authoritarianism" under the Trump administration, where legal and regulatory systems are perverted to weaken political opposition. The article cites recent actions, such as the temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show and threats against liberal NGOs, as tactics to erode civil society and concentrate power. This strategy, termed "salami slicing," involves targeting individuals or groups to avoid collective resistance.

His attendance emphasizes Beijing's strong focus on fostering ethnic unity and integrating ethnic minority groups into a singular Chinese national identity, a policy articulated as a "sense of community for the Chinese nation." This approach includes efforts to "sinicize religion" and comes amid persistent warnings from Beijing against extremist Islamic ideologies influencing Xinjiang. The visit underscores the central government's ongoing commitment to asserting control and promoting cultural assimilation in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the profound ethical dilemmas inherent in modern embryo testing, including PGT-A and polygenic screening, for selecting specific traits like disease resistance or intelligence. It critically examines the fine line between pursuing a healthier baby and engaging in "eugenics-y" practices, especially given the substantial costs that could exacerbate societal inequalities. The piece also highlights scientific uncertainties, such as pleiotropy, where single genes influence multiple traits, and warns of potential psychological harm if children perceive they failed to meet parental expectations based on genetic selection. Ultimately, the article advocates for parents to make "good enough" decisions, resisting commercial pressures to optimize every aspect of their child's biology.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic Basin is experiencing a notable increase in tropical activity, with the National Hurricane Center monitoring multiple systems, including Hurricane Gabrielle and two other disturbances with high development potential. One disturbance, situated between the Lesser Antilles and Cabo Verde Islands, has an 80% chance of forming a tropical depression within seven days, while another near the Lesser Antilles has a 50% chance. Forecasters anticipate environmental conditions will become more conducive for development, potentially leading to Tropical Storm Humberto.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the rising dissatisfaction among young, single men, who, contrary to stereotypes, are increasingly seeking romantic partnerships but facing difficulties. Studies indicate that single men report lower life satisfaction compared to single women and are less likely to initiate breakups. The piece attributes much of this "misery" to rigid masculine norms that often teach men to suppress emotions, leading them to view a romantic partner as their primary, and often only, emotional confidante. This emotional isolation can impede their ability to form deep connections, both platonic and romantic. The article advocates for a new model of masculinity that embraces vulnerability and broader social support to foster greater well-being.</p>

          <p>A UCLA annual survey debunks the prevailing "NIMBY" stereotype in Los Angeles, revealing that an overwhelming 86% of Angelenos support building more apartments, including within their own neighborhoods and on streets predominantly featuring single-family homes. This data contradicts the assumption that residents oppose increased housing density, offering a clear mandate for city leaders. The article advocates for Mayor Karen Bass to restore and potentially expand her affordable housing plan, Executive Directive 1, to leverage this public consensus. It emphasizes the importance of using representative survey data to guide policy decisions, rather than being swayed by vocal minorities, to effectively address the city's urgent housing scarcity.</p>

Led by Dr. Kathleen Martinez, the team utilized advanced sonar to map a former shoreline and inner harbor, yielding artifacts like anchors and amphorae. Martinez, who has dedicated two decades to this quest, hypothesizes Cleopatra chose Taposiris Magna—a religiously significant site outside Roman control—as her final resting place to evade Roman capture or posthumous humiliation.

          <p>This article delivers a sharp critique of ESPN's strategic shift, contending the network is abandoning its journalistic roots for influencer-driven "memebrain swill" in a bid to capture younger demographics. The author highlights the hiring of social media personalities and the NFL's acquisition of an equity stake in ESPN as indicative of a move towards a less critical, more accommodating relationship with sports leagues. This transformation, prioritizing live programming and narrative control, has led to the departure of highly regarded journalists. The article concludes that ESPN's current direction, symbolized by its "Sports Forever" slogan, signals a "post-journalistic" future focused on superficial content and clicks over in-depth analysis and truth.</p>
