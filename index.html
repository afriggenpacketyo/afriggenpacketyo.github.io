          <p>Journalism, ridden by Umberto Rispoli, won the 150th Preakness Stakes after a challenging race at Pimlico Race Course. The horse overcame bumping and jostling to surge past Gosger in the final stretch, marking trainer Michael McCarthy's second Triple Crown race win. Rispoli became the first Italian jockey to win a Triple Crown race, expressing immense pride in Journalism's performance. The victory was particularly poignant for co-owner Aaron Wellman, who emphasized the horse's guts and determination to win amidst adversity. The Preakness is set to move to Laurel Park next year before returning to a rebuilt Pimlico in 2027, but this year's race will be remembered for Journalism's memorable victory.</p>

          <p>A bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulting in one death and at least four injuries, prompting an FBI investigation. Authorities have labeled the event as an "intentional act of terrorism," with the blast originating near a vehicle parked by the American Reproductive Centers clinic. The explosion caused extensive damage, shattering windows and impacting buildings across several blocks, leading to a large-scale investigation involving the FBI, ATF, and local law enforcement. The clinic reported that its staff were unharmed and sensitive medical materials remained secure, expecting to resume normal operations soon. The investigation aims to determine whether the attack was domestic or international in nature.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michael Gove, a former Conservative minister, stated that a second Scottish independence referendum could be considered if there is "overwhelming support" for it among the Scottish people. While Gove doesn't believe another referendum is currently necessary, he cautioned against complacency and emphasized the need for the UK government to continually demonstrate the benefits of the union. His remarks align with SNP leader John Swinney's view that "demonstrable support" for independence is necessary before another vote can be pursued. Gove also defended the UK government's previous decision to veto Holyrood's Gender Recognition Reform bill, citing a recent Supreme Court ruling as vindication of that decision.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but restricted its use to older adults and individuals over 12 with high-risk medical conditions. This decision has sparked controversy, with some experts expressing disappointment and concern that it limits access for healthy individuals under 65 and could potentially impact public confidence in vaccines. The approval also requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects, which could be costly and time-consuming. Critics argue that the restrictions reflect skepticism towards vaccines within the FDA, potentially hindering efforts to combat COVID-19 and undermining established norms for vaccine approvals.</p>

          <p>A rare and intense dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, including Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings. The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms, originated near Bloomington, Illinois, and traveled at approximately 60 mph, reaching downtown Chicago by evening. This event marks the first time the Weather Service office in Romeoville has issued a dust storm warning for Chicago, with soil moisture levels in the area being exceptionally low. Similar dust storms have caused deadly accidents in the past, highlighting the dangers of reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions.</p>

His work, featured in a new book titled "Garden Safari," aims to celebrate the often-overlooked natural wonders found close to home. Inspired by his own battle with bowel cancer, Fusek Peters developed a technique to capture birds in mid-flight, showcasing the diffraction of light on their wings. He hopes his work will inspire others to transform their gardens into wildlife-friendly havens, emphasizing the importance of these spaces for struggling species.</p>

The survey also indicates a slight decline in the proportion of Japanese citizens who prioritize ties with the United States over China, suggesting a shift in societal perspectives. Trump announced a 90-day pause on implementing reciprocal tariffs for most countries, including Japan.</p>

          <p>Negotiations between New Jersey Transit executives and the union representing its train drivers adjourned without reaching a deal on Saturday, marking the second full day of the stateâ€™s first transit strike in 40 years. Discussions are set to resume on Sunday with the involvement of the National Mediation Board. The strike has disrupted the commuter rail network, stranding thousands and forcing the transit agency to implement contingency plans, including supplemental bus services. Both sides expressed a commitment to continuing negotiations in hopes of resolving the impasse, which primarily revolves around the issue of pay parity with other regional railroads.</p>
