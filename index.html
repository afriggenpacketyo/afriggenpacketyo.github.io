          <p>S&P Global Ratings has lowered the bond ratings for the city of Los Angeles, citing a weakening financial position and an emerging structural imbalance. The downgrade reflects concerns about the city's rapidly depleting reserve fund, which was used to address a budget deficit. This decision comes as Mayor Karen Bass proposes layoffs and seeks state aid to stabilize the city's finances. The lower bond ratings could lead to higher borrowing costs for Los Angeles, exacerbating its financial challenges.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a surge in cocaine use, prompting concerns from law enforcement and health officials.

The drug is easily accessible through messenger services, and its affordability makes it appealing across social classes.

          <p>A Durham University study reveals that chimpanzees demonstrate empathy by comforting each other in distress, challenging the perception of them as primarily violent. Researchers observed that chimpanzees were as likely as bonobos, traditionally considered more empathetic, to console one another through actions like embracing and holding hands. The study also found that younger apes were more likely to offer consolation. These findings suggest that emotional sensitivity develops early in apes and could provide insights into the evolution of human social behavior.</p>
