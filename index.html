          <p>Microsoft founder Bill Gates made a surprise appearance in the popular Hindi TV drama 'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi' alongside actress and former federal minister Smriti Irani. His four-minute segment focused on maternal and child health, aligning with the Gates Foundation's long-standing efforts to curb infant and maternal mortality in India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This unexpected cameo aims to leverage the show's wide reach for social messaging, emphasizing the importance of care for girls and mothers in a patriarchal society. The collaboration demonstrates how popular storytelling can effectively inform and inspire awareness on critical social issues.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a new U.S. strike in the Caribbean Sea, targeting a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang for drug trafficking. The operation, which took place at night in international waters, resulted in the deaths of all six men on board. This marks the tenth such strike by the Trump administration, bringing the total casualties to at least 43, and has broadened to include the Pacific Ocean. The campaign faces criticism from Colombia and U.S. lawmakers regarding its legality and effectiveness against lower-level traffickers.</p>

          <p>Britney Spears' ex-husband, Kevin Federline, has released a memoir titled 'You Thought You Knew,' offering his perspective on their tumultuous relationship and Spears' public struggles. This follows Spears' 2023 memoir, 'The Woman In Me,' where she detailed feeling controlled and used. Federline's book often contradicts Spears' narrative, particularly regarding the conservatorship, which he supported for their children's stability. The two memoirs collectively aim to reframe public understanding of their lives and the events leading to the pop star's conservatorship.</p>

          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, particularly in northern UK regions like Orkney and Shetland, many people experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring depression, linked to reduced daylight, causes low mood, anxiety, and fatigue. Experts recommend embracing outdoor activities and redesigning indoor spaces with comforting light. Initiatives like 'Wintering Well' boxes in Orkney, offering therapeutic lamps and activity guides, aim to help individuals develop routines for better mental health during darker months.</p>

          <h2>Debate Emerges Over Necessity of Learning Manual Driving Amidst Automatic Car Rise</h2>

          <p>A quiet shift towards automatic cars is evident in the UK, with one in three vehicles now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in them. This trend is driven by the upcoming 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, as electric vehicles lack manual gearboxes. For new drivers, the decision between manual and automatic is complex, influenced by instructor availability, cost, and the desire for quicker test passes. While manual licenses offer more flexibility, some argue that with automatics becoming the norm, manual skills may soon be obsolete.</p>

          <p>Vote counting for the Irish presidential election is set to begin, with results expected later today at Dublin Castle. Voters in the Republic of Ireland cast their ballots on Friday to elect the 10th Irish president, succeeding Michael D Higgins. The race features two primary contenders, Catherine Connolly and Heather Humphreys, alongside Jim Gavin, whose name remained on the ballot despite his withdrawal. Early indications suggest a potentially low voter turnout, possibly struggling to reach the record low seen in the 2018 election.</p>

          <p>Magnesium has become a popular supplement, with many claiming it aids sleep, digestion, and mental health, driving a booming global market. While magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, including brain function and blood sugar regulation, dietitians caution that supplements are only beneficial if one is deficient, which is difficult to accurately test. Despite widespread promotion by influencers, robust scientific evidence for broad positive effects on healthy individuals remains limited. Experts recommend prioritizing dietary sources and consulting professionals, as excessive intake can pose risks, particularly for those with kidney disease.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the U.S. of "fabricating a war" after the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, the world's largest warship, was deployed to the Caribbean. This move escalates the U.S. military build-up in the region, which Washington claims targets drug traffickers and has involved ten airstrikes, killing 43 individuals. Critics, including Maduro and U.S. lawmakers, question the legality and true intent of these operations, suggesting they are part of an intimidation campaign aimed at destabilizing Maduro's government and potentially leading to ground strikes.</p>

          <p>Chinese universities face criticism for an alleged STEM crisis, with experts like robotics guru Wang Xingxing arguing that outdated curricula prioritize theory over practical experience. This educational approach reportedly fails to prepare students for real-world employment and lags behind global cutting-edge technologies. While China is a rising force in critical tech sectors, educators and innovators fear the current system is not effectively nurturing bright minds for the "fourth industrial revolution." The article highlights concerns that knowledge taught in schools is often two decades behind industry needs.</p>

          <p>An attorney for Byron Black, a man executed on Tennessee death row, claims an electrocardiogram showed his heart remained active for nearly two minutes after he was pronounced dead. This allegation, made during litigation challenging the state's lethal injection protocols, raises serious questions about the execution's conduct, which his lawyer previously called "100% botched." Witnesses reported Black groaning in agony and saying "It hurts so bad" after the injection. The discovery suggests the pentobarbital may not have worked as intended, potentially violating the inmate's rights and exposing further suffering.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has terminated all trade negotiations with Canada, citing an "egregious" anti-tariff advertisement run by Ontario that featured former President Ronald Reagan. Trump claimed the ad, which quoted Reagan criticizing tariffs, was "FAKE" and misrepresented the former president's stance, a sentiment echoed by The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a pause on the ad campaign, expressing hope for resuming talks, but Trump's abrupt decision highlights escalating trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his wife, eldest son, and Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, accusing Petro of failing to stop drug production. This action further escalates tensions in the U.S. drug war, which has seen the deployment of military assets and targeted killings in the region. Petro defiantly responded, asserting his commitment to combating drug trafficking and refusing to yield to U.S. pressure. The sanctions follow Petro's accusations that the U.S. has violated international law by killing innocent people in its anti-drug operations.</p>

This move, aimed at ensuring "transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law," targets two Democratic states holding closely-watched elections. Democrats, however, fear it's an "intimidation tactic" to suppress votes and influence outcomes, given the Trump administration's past rhetoric on election integrity.

The administration labels those killed "unlawful combatants," but Congress has not authorized military force against cartels.

The article argues that Trump's refusal to spend appropriated funds and his efforts to raise revenues without congressional approval, such as through tariffs or private donations for a White House ballroom, undermine the legislature's role. Critics assert that this behavior signifies Trump's bid for American autocracy, making negotiations difficult with a president who disregards constitutional limits.

Hoka's projected growth was lowered to low-teens, and Ugg's to low-to-mid single digits for fiscal 2026. Finance chief Steven Fasching noted that tariffs and higher prices are clearly affecting U.S. consumer purchasing behavior in the discretionary space. Despite CEO Dave Powers downplaying long-term slowdown fears, the reduced forecasts signal potential loss of momentum for these top-performing lines. (not investment advice)</p>
