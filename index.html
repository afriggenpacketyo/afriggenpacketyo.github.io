          <p>Australian airline Qantas is investigating a significant cyberattack that targeted a third-party customer service platform, potentially exposing the data of six million customers. The compromised information includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, and birth dates, but the airline confirmed that passport and credit card details were not stored in the affected system. Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson apologized for the breach, which the company expects to be substantial, and has notified Australian federal police and cybersecurity authorities while containing the system.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to prematurely end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 520,000 Haitian immigrants in the U.S. The judge ruled that the Department of Homeland Security secretary acted unlawfully by not following the timeline and procedures mandated by Congress for reconsidering the TPS designation. This decision temporarily preserves the protections, which allow individuals from countries facing extraordinary conditions to live and work legally in the United States, from being terminated ahead of schedule.</p>
