          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded the race after initial results showed Mamdani leading with 44% of the vote. Cuomo, who resigned from the governorship in 2021 after facing accusations of sexual harassment, conceded to Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, who capitalized on social media virality and enthusiasm among younger voters. Cuomo indicated he might consider an independent run in November, despite the Democratic primary winner likely having an advantage in the heavily Democratic city. The Board of Elections will certify the results on July 15 after ranked-choice tabulations are completed, due to no candidate reaching over 50% of the vote. </p>

          <p>A family in South London is living in fear after their neighbor threatened the father with a knife and damaged their property, including smashing a car windscreen with a hammer. The family claims their housing association, Wandle, has failed to take adequate action despite numerous incidents being recorded on camera. The neighbor pleaded guilty to threatening with a blade and will be sentenced in July, but the anti-social behavior continues to affect the family's well-being and studies. The housing ombudsman reports a significant increase in complaints about social landlords failing to protect tenants from anti-social behavior, highlighting a broader issue of inadequate support and cooperation between agencies.</p>

Speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China, Li emphasized that globalization is irreversible and engaging in the international economy is a way of reshaping the rules and order. He called on countries to keep to the right path, without commenting on specific U.S. trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict. Columbia University professor Adam Tooze described Li's comment on reshaping the rules and order as very interesting, suggesting a pluralization of processes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's unpredictable governing style is causing tension at the NATO summit in The Hague, as European leaders struggle to balance their national interests with the need to appease the US president. Trump's disdain for European democracies and his willingness to disrupt established alliances have forced NATO members into an awkward dance, striving to impress him while also planning for the possibility of his abandonment. The war in the Middle East and Russia's ongoing aggression in Ukraine further heighten the uncertainty, as European leaders grapple with complex calculations while Trump prioritizes easy wins and personal motives. Trump's volatile persona generates chaos, exposing his impotence and provoking him to tug in more arbitrary fury at his levers of power.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended the NATO Summit in The Hague, Netherlands, expressing a surprisingly cordial tone toward the alliance he has previously criticized. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump for encouraging increased defense spending among European members, reaching a new 5% target. Despite progress, Trump cast doubt on whether the U.S. would abide by NATO’s mutual defense clause, Article 5, while Rutte urged partners to strengthen their own defenses. The new spending target breaks down into 3.5% for core defense spending and 1.5% for related infrastructure, with Poland leading member states at 4.1% of GDP towards defense.</p>

          <p>A China-led study suggests that a global solar-wind energy network could meet the world's energy demands by 2050 at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The researchers propose creating an interconnected system that draws on regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply areas with high energy needs. While geopolitical boundaries and crises pose challenges, successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease decarbonization, and enhance resilience against conflict and climate extremes. The study emphasizes that the potential of solar and wind resources on Earth vastly surpasses human demand.</p>

These studios often target teenagers with promises of easy money, but many models face issues such as a lack of contracts, pressure to perform certain acts, and exploitation by unscrupulous operators. The global sexcam industry is booming, with Colombia estimated to have the highest number of models, and while platforms have checks to ensure performers are over 18, these are easily circumvented. Models report using recycled accounts or fake IDs to appear on platforms, underscoring the need for stricter regulations and better protection for performers.</p>

          <p>IVF patients are being warned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after one such company, Apricity Fertility, went bust, leaving many clients without treatment or refunds. These online concierge companies act as middlemen between patients, donors, and doctors, but are not directly regulated by the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Several patients lost significant amounts of money and faced disruptions to their treatment plans due to Apricity's closure, highlighting the need for stronger legal protections for patients using these services. The HFEA is calling for revisions to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act to account for the different ways fertility services are provided.</p>

Lattouf said she was punished for her political opinion, while the ABC apologized for its handling of the matter, stating that it had let down its staff and audiences.

The agreement reflects resistance to proposed cuts, opting instead to borrow money, tap into state reserves, and shift funding to offset a $12-billion deficit. The budget includes a "poison pill" that requires legislators to pass a bill lessening environmental review requirements for building projects. The deal restores cost-of-living adjustments for child-care workers and rejects a cap on overtime hours for in-home caregivers, while also providing additional funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants.</p>

          <p>Following US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, there are reports that the US and Iran are considering restarting nuclear talks, according to a Trump envoy. A preliminary US intelligence assessment found that Iran's nuclear program has only been set back by a few months. The White House has disputed this assessment, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stating that it was flat-out wrong and leaked by a low-level loser in the intelligence community. Despite the strikes, the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities and sites remains unclear.</p>

The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, found that the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities to be sealed off, with resumption of the enrichment program dependent on repairs. The White House has pushed back on the findings, calling the assessment flat-out wrong and accusing intelligence officials of leaking the information to demean President Trump.
