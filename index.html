          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the requirement to adopt the same surname, a law unique to Japan. The survey highlights that around 40% of people in their 20s would consider legal marriage if separate surnames were permitted. The survey estimates that over half a million people in common-law relationships wish to marry but are deterred by the current law, which also denies common-law couples benefits like spouse tax deductions and inheritance rights. This article underscores the ongoing debate between those advocating for individual rights and conservatives prioritizing traditional family values.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with nearly 12,000 new coffee shops opening in the past year, driven by increased accessibility and price competition.
