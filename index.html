          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has criticized the U.S.'s "silence" following recent Russian attacks, stating that it encourages President Vladimir Putin. This follows Moscow's largest aerial assault, with 367 drones and missiles fired, resulting in numerous casualties and widespread damage across Ukraine. Zelenskyy urged Trump and other world leaders to increase pressure on Putin, stating that silence only encourages him. Trump responded by expressing his displeasure with Putin's actions and considering further sanctions.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has filed a complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) after a controversial refereeing decision during their match against Manchester United. The referee prematurely blew his whistle, disallowing a potential goal for Villa, which VAR could not review. Villa captain John McGinn criticized the decision as "incredible" and suggested that more experienced referees should be used. Pundits agreed that the referee made a mistake by blowing the whistle too early.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd’s murder, the Black Lives Matter movement faces a significant backlash, with the politics of "white grievance" gaining prominence. Despite initial widespread support, the movement's popularity has declined, and many Americans believe that the increased focus on race has not improved the lives of Black people. President Trump's administration is dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, reflecting a shift in racial discourse. However, some activists remain optimistic, viewing the backlash as a temporary setback in the long struggle for racial justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called “emotionally safe parenting” has been developed. This style prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, rather than strict rules or empathy alone. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, view misbehavior as a signal for support, and take responsibility after conflicts. By creating a safe environment for children to express their feelings, parents can foster emotional resilience, trust, and connection.</p>
