          <p>Former President Trump announced plans to reopen and significantly enlarge Alcatraz prison to house America's most violent offenders. He stated this move symbolizes law, order, and justice, addressing frustrations with radicalized judges and due process requirements for deportations. The Bureau of Prisons stated it would comply with any Presidential Orders, while Nancy Pelosi questioned the feasibility of the proposal, given Alcatraz's current status as a popular national park and tourist destination. Alcatraz, a maximum-security prison closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, has since become a major tourist attraction and a National Park Service site.</p>

          <p>The United States has declined Japan's appeal for a complete exemption from reciprocal tariffs, including a 10% levy, during recent trade negotiations. US officials have indicated that they are only willing to consider a reduction in the 14% country-specific tariff, which is currently suspended until early July. Japan has been advocating for the elimination of all reciprocal tariffs, including additional levies on cars, steel, and aluminum, emphasizing its significant contributions to the US economy through investment and job creation. Washington insists that it will not negotiate the baseline levy or tariffs on automotive and steel products.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for overpayments from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, following concerns that full clawbacks would cause severe financial strain. This change applies to new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25, while the withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remains at 10%. Experts warn that even a 50% reduction in benefits can still lead to devastating consequences for beneficiaries who rely on these payments for essential needs. The Alliance for Retired Americans emphasizes that overpayments are often not the fault of the beneficiaries and they should not suffer hardship due to administrative errors.</p>

          <p>Despite Western sanctions, Russia's economy has shown surprising resilience, prompting speculation on how it would respond to potential secondary sanctions from the US under a Trump administration. While economists expect Russia's growth to slow, the impact of new sanctions on its economic partners like China and India remains uncertain. Reuters reported that major Russian banks have established a payment system with China to reduce visibility to Western regulators, potentially mitigating the effects of secondary sanctions. The effectiveness of these measures will depend on enforcement and the willingness of countries to comply with US policies.</p>

The study, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, found that the number of people receiving psychotherapy increased from 6.5% in 2018 to 8.5% in 2021. This trend suggests a shift towards more holistic mental health care, with greater accessibility and awareness of the benefits of talk therapy. Telehealth expansions and the inclusion of licensed counselors and social workers in providing therapy have contributed to this positive change.</p>

Economists largely agree that manufacturing will not return to its mid-20th century prominence due to automation and the shift to service industry jobs.

With the collapse of a two-month cease-fire in March, Israel has blocked humanitarian aid and renewed heavy bombardment.
