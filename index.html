        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Education Department has stated that Columbia University is in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws and consequently fails to meet accreditation standards. This determination follows accusations that the university's leadership acted with deliberate indifference toward the harassment of Jewish students after the October 7th attack against Israel by Hamas. The department's civil rights office has notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, which accredits U.S. colleges and universities, of Columbia's non-compliance. Losing accreditation would mean that Columbia would be ineligible to offer federal financial aid to students attending the university, impacting student loans and Pell Grants. The department found that Columbia failed to protect Jewish students against severe and pervasive harassment, denying them equal access to educational opportunities. The optimism score is being reflected as a multiple of 5 between 0 and 100.</p>

          <p>Thomasz Szabo, a Romanian national, pleaded guilty to leading a scheme targeting dozens of politicians and social media influencers with swatting attacks. Szabo built a network of swatters in 2018 to unleash havoc on public figures in the United States, making false emergency calls to police to lure SWAT teams to targets' homes. His co-conspirators targeted at least 25 members of Congress or their families, six executive branch officials and Cabinet members, judges, members of the media, and at least two dozen former government officials. The technology and techniques employed by swatters are becoming more sophisticated and potent, often using AI-generated sound effects to give credibility to fictitious active shooter events.

          <p>Elon Musk has increased his criticism of President Donald Trump's tax-cut bill, claiming it will lead to "debt slavery" for America and urging lawmakers to reject it. Musk criticized the budget package on his social media site X, suggesting a new spending bill should be drafted that doesn't massively grow the deficit. This opposition comes days after Musk departed the Trump administration, where he headed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's stance is partly due to the bill's cuts to an electric vehicle tax credit, which benefits Tesla. The optimism score is being reflected as a multiple of 5 between 0 and 100.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move experts say could increase costs on a wide range of products. While the U.S. has its own domestic metals manufacturing, it also relies on imports from abroad, particularly from Canada. Experts say the levies will raise the cost of manufacturing on a wide range of products, making many items more expensive to buy, as businesses typically pass on tariff-related costs to consumers. Some consumer categories that could get pricier include cars, sports equipment, beer and soda cans, canned goods, household appliances, and homes.

          <p>Civilians in Darfur are bearing the brunt of the brutal two-year civil war between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). A UN convoy taking food to the besieged city of El Fasher was attacked, resulting in the deaths of five UN staff and the destruction of supplies. The Sudan conflict has killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly 13 million, and created a severe humanitarian crisis. The U.S., UN experts, and the Sudanese army accuse the RSF and allied militias of committing genocide against Black African ethnic groups in Darfur.

          <p>The U.S. economy has contracted over the past six weeks, with hiring slowing and concerns about tariff-related price increases, according to a Federal Reserve report. The "Beige Book" summary noted that "economic activity has declined slightly since the previous report." Elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions. The report highlighted lower labor demand and widespread reports of contacts expecting costs and prices to rise at a faster rate. The optimism score is being reflected as a multiple of 5 between 0 and 100. (not investment advice)</p>
