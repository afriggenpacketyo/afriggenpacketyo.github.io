          <p>Two years after taking a break to focus on his mental health, singer Lewis Capaldi made a highly anticipated surprise return to the Glastonbury festival. He performed for a massive, supportive crowd, opening with his hit song "Before You Go." This appearance follows a difficult 2023 performance where he struggled with his Tourette's syndrome, leading to his hiatus from the spotlight. The comeback was also marked by the release of a new single, "Survive," which addresses his personal struggles and determination to overcome them.</p>

Monzo also injured five other people, including two police officers, during the 20-minute rampage. The judge noted that Monzo's actions were the result of psychosis induced by his long-term cannabis use, which diminished his responsibility but did not excuse his crimes.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has adjusted his government's proposed welfare reforms after facing significant opposition from his own Labour MPs. The initial plan would have tightened eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip), but the stricter criteria will now only apply to new claimants. Additionally, the government reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit for existing recipients. While the concessions have satisfied many rebels, some MPs still intend to vote against the bill, signaling ongoing division.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent economic data indicates that U.S. trade tariffs are starting to translate into higher consumer prices and lower inventory levels across distribution networks. Logistics firms report an increase in re-ticketing products with price hikes ranging from 8% to 15% for various goods. Simultaneously, retailers and manufacturers are shrinking their inventory, holding about half of what they did previously, due to trade uncertainty and concerns about consumer softness. This trend, along with fewer shipping containers being sent for refilling, suggests a milder-than-usual peak shopping season ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

The strategy includes reintroducing popular Hemi V-8 engines, launching lower-priced models, returning to NASCAR, and offering a new 10-year powertrain warranty. Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, aims to increase Ram's full-size truck market share to over 20%. The turnaround also involves delaying the launch of all-electric models in favor of a plug-in hybrid, reflecting current market demand and a focus on core products.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 to uphold a Texas law that mandates pornography websites verify the age of their visitors. The law, aimed at preventing minors from accessing adult content, requires sites with over a third of pornographic material to confirm users are 18 or older. A trade group representing adult entertainment companies had challenged the law, arguing it unconstitutionally burdens adults' free speech and poses privacy risks. The ruling sets a significant precedent for the nearly two dozen other states that have enacted similar age-verification laws.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration should aggressively prosecute government officials who leak classified or sensitive information to the media. The author contends that journalists in the current media environment often grant instant credulity to leakers who have partisan motives, leading to the spread of misinformation, citing a recent leak about a strike on Iran. The piece suggests that by re-establishing the personal risk of leaking, such as facing jail time, it would force journalists to be more skeptical and context-aware.

          <p>The Supreme Court has reined in the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies across the entire country. In a 6-3 decision related to President Trump's birthright citizenship order, the court ruled that such universal orders likely exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion stated that injunctions should typically be limited to providing relief only to the specific plaintiffs in a case. The ruling is a significant check on a judicial tool that has been used to halt major policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. stock market indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, opened in record territory on Friday. Investor optimism was fueled by signs of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations and growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. The S&P 500 has surged approximately 25% since early April, recovering from a brief bear market caused by tariff concerns. While the market celebrates, some analysts caution against complacency, noting that geopolitical and trade uncertainties could still create volatility in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large, bright meteor streaked across the sky over Georgia and South Carolina, culminating in an explosion that created audible booms for residents below. NASA reported the fireball, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. It detonated 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, releasing energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the daylight event, which experts suggest may have been part of the rarely seen Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

Both injured officers are men with approximately six years of service each. Assistant Chief Nicole Waldner attributed the violence to the widespread availability of guns rather than department staffing issues, calling the event a horrible thing for the city.</p>

The verdict is a landmark case, being the first of its kind since Louisiana's Supreme Court upheld a law allowing survivors to sue regardless of when the abuse occurred.

The decision to restore the case to its calendar for the next term means the current map, which was used in the 2024 elections, will remain in place for now. The case centers on whether the GOP-led legislature unconstitutionally relied on race when drawing the new district to comply with the Voting Rights Act.

The ruling is a major victory for public health advocates, as it preserves no-cost access to a wide range of services, including cancer screenings and HIV-prevention drugs, for approximately 150 million Americans.

This political pressure is creating market uncertainty, with traders increasing bets on interest rate cuts this year.

          <p>This article explores the potential monthly income from a $300,000 annuity for a 65-year-old retiree, highlighting how annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream. Based on current data, a 65-year-old man could expect around $1,942 per month, while a woman could expect about $1,861, with the difference due to women's longer life expectancy. A joint-life annuity for a couple would pay less, around $1,684 monthly. The piece notes that payouts are influenced by interest rates, annuity type, and optional features like inflation protection, which can reduce the initial monthly amount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis piece argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions is less of a clear-cut victory for President Trump than it may appear. While the ruling curtails the ability of a single judge to block a policy nationwide, it leaves open the possibility for broad injunctions when necessary to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs, such as states arguing against a patchwork of laws. The author suggests the decision is a serious, albeit delayed, response to the overuse of such injunctions against both Democratic and Republican administrations. It does not resolve the underlying constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself.</p>
