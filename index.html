          <p>Israeli attacks on Gaza have resulted in numerous fatalities and injuries, according to local health officials, as Palestinians desperately seek food handouts amidst a chaotic aid operation. The United Nations has criticized the aid system as insufficient, and a Gaza warehouse run by the World Food Program was broken into by hungry people, resulting in further casualties. Israel and Hamas are considering a new cease-fire proposal mediated by President Trump's special envoy, which includes the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a 60-day cease-fire with increased aid flow. However, disagreements persist regarding guarantees for a permanent cessation of hostilities and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the situation is dire, with hospitals overwhelmed and lacking adequate resources to provide medical care. The situation is catastrophic and dire.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.- and Israel-backed aid group, is winding down its Swiss operations after Swiss authorities cited breaches of regulations for registered foundations. GHF will now operate solely from the United States, following legal complications in Switzerland, including not having a resident signatory board member, the minimum required board members, or a Swiss bank account. Meanwhile, the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health reported casualties at a GHF aid distribution hub, although GHF denies any shots were fired at Palestinian crowds. The United Nations has declined to work with GHF due to concerns about its methods and the presence of armed contractors at distribution centers, raising questions about potential displacement of the Gaza population.</p>

However, U.S. export controls are impacting sales in China, which Nvidia estimates to be a $50 billion market. Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of the data center revenue, and the company is focusing on the potential for its GPUs to serve AI models to millions of customers through AI inference. Nvidia's Blackwell chips are designed to meet the surging demand for reasoning AI, but the export controls are driving AI talent to use chips from homegrown Chinese rivals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A partial glacier collapse in Switzerland caused a landslide that buried 90% of the village of Blatten, leaving one man missing. Authorities had evacuated the village earlier this month as a precaution, but the landslide sent mud and rocks down the mountainside, submerging homes and buildings. A search and rescue operation is underway, and there is a risk of an ice jam that could flood the valley below. Swiss glaciologists have expressed concerns about the accelerated retreat of glaciers due to global warming, with Switzerland losing 4% of its total glacier volume in 2023.</p>

          <p>A panel of U.S. federal judges blocked the Trump administration’s threat to impose tariffs on the European Union and other trading partners, leading to cautious reactions from trade experts and global economies. Stocks rose internationally, but economists warn that the administration could pursue other legal avenues to enact tariffs, leaving economies like Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union, and India in continued uncertainty. While the court decision blocks across-the-board tariffs, it does not roll back sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars, guaranteeing continued trade negotiations. The administration could also open investigations into trading partners, which could then be used as the basis for more sustained tariffs.</p>

          <p>Twenty-two young Americans have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that its pro-fossil fuel executive orders violate their constitutional rights to life and liberty. The lawsuit claims that by intentionally boosting oil and gas production and stymying carbon-free energy, federal officials are breaching congressional mandates to protect ecosystems and public health. The plaintiffs, aged seven to 25, hail from climate-impacted states and argue that the orders have violated the state-created danger doctrine. The litigation targets three executive orders aimed at bolstering US energy production and suppressing climate research, and the youth plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the orders unconstitutional and block their implementation.</p>

          <p>A recent US court ruling blocking President Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. The tariffs that the court ruled illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are the bulk of what the UK exports to the US. Although the UK has a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, that deal is yet to come into force. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs of 10% on other UK goods entering the US, such as products like salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, saving money can be a challenge, but a certificate of deposit (CD) can help by offering higher returns than the current inflation rate. Today's leading accounts come with strong returns that can be locked in for the term of the CD and are generally FDIC or NCUA insured on balances up to $250,000. To get a good CD rate, it is advised to look at online banks and consider short-term CDs, which often have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve (not investment advice). A practical approach could be to ladder your CDs to take advantage of high rates while saving for the long-term.</p>

          <p>The article outlines the current average mortgage and refinance interest rates, as of May 29, 2025, noting that actual rates may vary based on location, credit, and loan type. The average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.14%, and the 30-year mortgage rate is 6.95%, while average refinance rates are similar. To secure a great rate, borrowers should strengthen their credit profile, shop around, and compare different lenders, and borrowers may soon see some relief if the Fed decides to pause rate hikes following its July rate increase (not investment advice). Shorter loan terms generally offer better interest rates, and borrowers should factor in fees and lock in their rate after making a decision.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis reveals the top U.S. cities where retirees live on the highest annual incomes from Social Security and savings, with Carlsbad, California, leading at $85,442. The analysis indicates that Social Security and retirement account withdrawals make up the majority of retirees' income, with higher earners tending to receive larger Social Security checks and save more for retirement. Social Security payments don't vary as widely as retirement account withdrawals, with cities like Carlsbad, Bellevue, and Naperville topping the list for high retirement incomes (not investment advice). The amount received from Social Security varies based on factors like work history, contributions, and claiming age.</p>

          <p>MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace is launching a new podcast called “The Best People,” featuring conversations with actors, musicians, and thought leaders outside of politics. This move comes as MSNBC looks for more ways to reach consumers who are no longer watching cable TV, with the network planning to spin off into a new company called Versant. Wallace's podcast will focus on her guests' advocacy issues rather than instant political analysis, and she believes the podcast format allows for more candid conversations. The spinoff requires separating MSNBC from NBC News, with Versant hiring its own newsgathering team.</p>

The spacecraft lost attitude control, broke up in orbit, and tumbled on re-entry, raising questions about long-term reliability and safety. While SpaceX operates on a principle of rapid iteration and treats test failures as learning opportunities, repeated costly failures of Starship have caused some to question the timeline. Although the company hopes its "fail fast, learn fast" approach will eventually pay off, it remains unclear if Starship will be ready for a crewed mission to the moon by mid-2027.</p>

          <p>Stock market futures jumped after a federal court froze most of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled President Trump had overstepped his legal authority in assessing a 10% levy in April, and overseas markets also rose following the surprise legal decision. The ruling means the baseline 10% tariff, reciprocal tariffs on dozens of other nations, and other levies are void, but the Trump administration said it will appeal the ruling (not investment advice). The ruling by the three-judge panel means the baseline 10% tariff; so-called reciprocal tariffs on dozens of other nations that the U.S. had paused for 90 days; a 20% levy on China related to fentanyl; and a 25% tax on certain imports from Canada and Mexico are void.</p>

          <h2>Government Fast-Tracks New Reservoirs to Secure Water Supply</h2>

          <p>England could face drinking water shortages within a decade unless new reservoirs are built, a minister has claimed, leading the government to speed up the planning process for two reservoir projects. Final decisions about the proposed Fens Reservoir in Cambridgeshire and the Lincolnshire Reservoir will be taken by the Environment Secretary to expedite the process. With climate change likely to bring hotter, drier summers, the chances of drought could increase in the decades ahead, and household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures. Some experts warn that managing how we use water needs to take greater precedence in a warming climate.</p>
