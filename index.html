        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale tourism project at Egypt's Mount Sinai, a site sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is facing significant backlash. Critics argue the development, which includes luxury hotels and villas, is destroying the area's pristine, spiritual character and has led to the displacement of the local Jebeleya Bedouin tribe with little compensation. The project has also caused diplomatic tensions with Greece over the status of the historic St. Catherine's Monastery. While the Egyptian government promotes the plan as a way to boost its struggling economy, heritage groups warn of irreversible damage to a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

          <p>Both Ukraine and Russia are heavily utilizing decoy military equipment to mislead one another and deplete valuable resources in their ongoing conflict. Ukrainian forces, often aided by volunteers, are deploying full-scale mock-ups of high-value assets like the British M777 howitzer, which can cost as little as $500 to produce. These decoys are designed to draw fire from expensive Russian munitions, such as Lancet drones costing around $35,000. This strategy of deception extends to inflatable tanks, fake radar signatures, and even dummy soldiers, proving to be a highly effective and asymmetrical tactic on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>Texas A&M defensive lineman Cashius Howell accomplished a remarkable and rare feat during his team's victory over Utah State. In the second quarter, Howell managed to sack the opposing quarterback on three consecutive plays, single-handedly forcing a punt and stunning observers. This accomplishment is exceptionally unusual in college football, with research indicating it was the first time a player had recorded sacks on three straight plays since 2015. Howell's dominant performance was a key factor in the No. 19 Aggies' decisive win.</p>

Known for his passion for technology, Acutis created websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His canonization is seen as a significant move by the Vatican to connect with younger generations, as he enjoyed video games and wore jeans like many of his peers. The ceremony follows the attribution of two miracles to his intercession.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has fallen by more than 80% following the Trump administration's decision to eliminate a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports.

Many foreign postal operators and airlines were unprepared or unwilling to manage the new duty collection process, leading to a near-halt in shipments and the suspension of services from 88 postal operators worldwide.

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their 30th consecutive victory and a place in the quarter-finals with a 47-7 win over Australia. Despite the lopsided final score, England delivered an untidy and unsettled performance in the first half, struggling against Australia's intensity and tactical kicking game. The team's powerful driving maul, usually a reliable weapon, was initially ineffective. While their dominant second-half performance and strong defense were positives, the early struggles against a lower-ranked opponent may offer encouragement to stronger rivals in the knockout stages.</p>

Despite dominating possession, England lacked creativity and momentum, leading to a subdued atmosphere at Villa Park with many fans leaving before the final whistle, raising concerns ahead of a tougher match against Serbia.</p>

He predicts that the wealthy will use AI to replace human workers, leading to massive unemployment and a huge surge in profits for a select few, ultimately making most people poorer. Hinton asserts that this outcome is not an inherent flaw of AI technology itself, but rather a direct consequence of the existing capitalist system. (not investment advice)</p>
