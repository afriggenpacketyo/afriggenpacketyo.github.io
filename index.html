          <h2>Poll Indicates American Disapproval of Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 18:11:10 EDT</div>

          <p>A recent poll reveals that 59% of Americans disapprove of President Trump's increasing tariffs on imported goods. Despite Trump's assurances to be "nice" amid trade war concerns, China has criticized the U.S. for coercion and threats. Stocks showed signs of recovery after a market downturn fueled by fears that Trump would attempt to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, although the president later stated he would not take such action. This comes as Trump's trade policies continue to face scrutiny and impact global markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering exemptions for automakers from some tariffs imposed by his administration, including those on auto parts from China and levies on steel and aluminum. Automakers and policy groups have been lobbying for relief, as tariffs have been stacking up on the automotive industry. While autos were previously exempted from "reciprocal" geographical tariffs, the industry still faces tariffs on steel, aluminum, and imported vehicles.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old man died in Northern Kentucky Wednesday after the bed of a concrete truck fell onto him, the Boone County Sheriff's Office said. At approximately 10 a.m., the sheriff's office was dispatched to Galileo Boulevard in Union, according to public information officer Major Philip Ridgell. The 28-year-old man was working on the hydraulic line of a concrete truck when the line failed and the truck's bed fell, Ridgell said. He added the man was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

          <p>A group of about three dozen teenagers on bicycles stole from a Ralphs near USC before hurling homophobic slurs and rocks at two men in a car outside the store. Their actions follow a similar pattern of reports of large groups of teens on bikes stealing from stores and attacking drivers across the city over the last several months. Police arrested at least two individuals, both minors, in connection with a previous violent attack on a driver near Beverly Hills in February.</p>
