          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog addressed concerns about Israel's intentions toward Iran, stating that regime change is not the primary objective. Instead, the focus is on dismantling Iran's nuclear program, which Herzog accuses of rapidly advancing towards creating a nuclear weapon. Herzog emphasized that while a change in regime could bring peace, the immediate goal is to eliminate the nuclear threat. He also mentioned ongoing back-channel talks and dialogue with world leaders to de-escalate tensions. Optimism that the situation can be resolved through diplomacy remains cautiously high.</p>

These firearms can be assembled using a 3D printer, downloadable blueprints, and basic materials. An investigation revealed advertisements for guns, including 3D-printed models, on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram. While companies claim to remove such content, loopholes exist, allowing potential dealers to exploit the system.
