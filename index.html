          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block on a judge's order, allowing President Trump to maintain control of the National Guard in Los Angeles. This decision enables the continued deployment of troops to protect federal property and assist immigration agents during enforcement operations. Governor Newsom, who opposes the use of troops, sued the president, but the court sided with Trump, citing his statutory authority under Title 10. The court emphasized the need for deference to the president's judgment in deploying troops, while Newsom expressed disappointment and vowed to continue challenging the deployment.</p>

          <p>Europe's ambition to lead in decarbonized transportation hinges on securing lithium supplies, but faces obstacles from China's dominance and a lack of investment. While Europe has established a regulatory framework emphasizing environmental protection and cooperation, it struggles to match China's financial commitment to lithium projects. The investment gap is significant, with China spending billions more on lithium projects abroad. This disparity threatens Europe's ability to compete in the growing market for batteries and clean energy technologies, potentially undermining its broader energy security and climate goals.</p>

While shark attacks are statistically rare, certain beaches, like New Smyrna Beach in Florida, are known as hotspots. Activists emphasize the importance of shark conservation and education to dispel myths and promote respect for these creatures, encouraging people to stay calm and avoid erratic movements if they encounter a shark in the water.</p>

Pilgrimages to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar, sacred sites for multiple religions, had been suspended for five years due to COVID-19 and cross-border issues. The Indian government is organizing the pilgrimages, which involve treks through mountain passes, and thousands have applied to participate.

The government maintains that these reforms will fix a broken welfare system and support those who can and want to work. The proposed bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and reduces the sickness-related element of universal credit.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the UK are actively pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Tensions remain high following an explosion outside the Norwegian ambassador's residence in Tel Aviv, prompting condemnation from Israeli officials. The incident occurred amidst ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation and prevent further regional instability. Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, has recently recognized a Palestinian State, adding complexity to its relationship with Israel.</p>
