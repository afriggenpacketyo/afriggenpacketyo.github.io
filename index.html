          <p>England's captain, Harry Kane, will miss the upcoming friendly match against Wales because of a minor injury. The Bayern Munich striker sustained a kick to his ankle during a recent club game and did not participate in team training. Manager Thomas Tuchel expressed hope that Kane, the team's all-time leading goalscorer, will recover in time to play in the World Cup qualifier against Latvia next Tuesday. In his absence, the captaincy will be given to one of several senior players, with Ollie Watkins or Marcus Rashford expected to fill the forward position.</p>

Derrick Groves, a 28-year-old convicted of second-degree murder, was apprehended in Atlanta following a brief standoff, concluding a months-long, multi-agency manhunt. The escape, which occurred through a hole behind a toilet, was described by the district attorney as a "serious breach of public safety." Over a dozen people have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees during their time on the run.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are forcing a vote under the War Powers Act to halt U.S. military strikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats near Venezuela without congressional approval. The resolution follows several Trump administration-ordered attacks that have killed at least 21 people, which the White House justifies as a "non-international armed conflict" against cartels. Proponents of the vote argue the strikes are unconstitutional and risk escalating into a broader conflict, while the administration maintains the president has the authority to act in self-defense.</p>

Analysts attribute the 53% year-to-date rally to factors including the ongoing government shutdown, expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and strong demand from global central banks. Despite a strong stock market, gold's traditional role as a safe-haven asset is driving its current appeal during this period of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 29-year-old Jonathan Rinderknecht, accusing him of maliciously starting a fire on January 1st that later erupted into the devastating Palisades Fire. The blaze, one of the most destructive in Los Angeles history, resulted in 12 deaths and destroyed thousands of structures. According to the Department of Justice, the initial fire smoldered underground for nearly a week before high winds caused it to spread. Digital evidence, including inquiries made to ChatGPT, reportedly played a role in identifying Rinderknecht as the suspect.</p>

          <p>Roundhill Investments has resurrected its exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on meme stocks, trading again under the ticker MEME. The move aims to provide investors with a way to engage with the volatile class of stocks popularized by social media trends. However, some market analysts are viewing the relaunch as a potential indicator of market froth, drawing parallels to the fund's original launch in late 2021, which coincided with a market peak. The new version of the ETF includes holdings like Opendoor Technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United's co-owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has publicly backed manager Ruben Amorim, stating that the coach needs a three-year timeframe to demonstrate his capabilities.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding. The indictment relates to his 2020 testimony before a Senate committee regarding the bureau's investigations into Hillary Clinton in 2016. Comey's legal team has indicated they will seek to have the case dismissed, citing vindictive prosecution and challenging the appointment of the U.S. attorney overseeing the case. A tentative trial date has been set for early January, though legal challenges may alter the schedule.</p>
