          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:36:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Critics have expressed disappointment after a Justice Department memo stated there was no "incriminating client list" and confirmed Epstein's death as a suicide, contrary to many conspiracy theories. The memo's release has reportedly caused a rift between the Justice Department and the FBI, with some officials contemplating resignation over the findings. Trump has voiced frustration with the continued public focus on the matter.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:32:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following negotiations with the global players' union, Fifpro, FIFA has agreed to introduce mandatory rest periods to protect players from injury and burnout. The new rules will include a minimum 72-hour gap between matches and a three-week break at the end of each season. This consensus comes after Fifpro filed a lawsuit against FIFA over the expanded Club World Cup, raising concerns about the increasingly congested fixture calendar. The move is seen as a significant first step in addressing player welfare amid the sport's global expansion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the Big 12 Media Days, Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders called for the NCAA to enforce stricter uniform rules in college football, similar to the NFL's fine system. He expressed frustration with players wearing gear like biker shorts and lacking proper knee pads, arguing it shows a lack of respect for the game. Sanders, who recently signed a five-year extension with Colorado, also addressed questions about his health, stating he feels well and is focused on his team. The coach has previously dealt with significant health issues, including blood clots.</p>

          <p>Official records reportedly show that many buildings at Camp Mystic, the site of a recent deadly flood in Texas, were removed from high-risk flood maps years ago. According to US media, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially designated the camp as a high-risk area in 2011, but the camp successfully appealed these classifications. This revelation has raised serious questions about regulatory oversight, especially given that 27 children died when floodwaters from the Guadalupe River inundated the camp. Experts find the exemptions troubling for a riverside camp that houses children.</p>

          <p>The decision by Republican Senator Thom Tillis not to seek re-election is set to make North Carolina's 2026 Senate race highly competitive. His departure creates an open seat, intensifying the political battleground in a key swing state. This development provides a significant opportunity for Democrats, who are hopeful they can flip the seat and gain a crucial foothold in the Senate. The announcement has reset the political landscape, with both parties now strategizing for what is expected to be an expensive and closely watched contest.</p>

The article highlights its success in cracking numerous cases, such as identifying a man who committed a sexual assault in 1997. While the method has proven highly effective, it also raises significant questions about genetic privacy and the ethics of using personal data for criminal investigations.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is enhancing its security protocols with new technology. The agency has deployed a fleet of military-grade drones and mobile command posts to improve aerial surveillance and inter-agency communication. These upgrades directly address failures from the Butler incident, where a shooter operated a drone undetected and law enforcement agencies could not communicate directly. The new command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, will ensure seamless radio contact with local police at future events.</p>

          <p>Starting in late July 2025, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will begin withholding up to 50% of monthly benefits from recipients who have been overpaid and have not arranged a repayment plan. This new policy is part of a broader effort to recover billions in accidental overpayments made to beneficiaries. The SSA reportedly attempted to reclaim funds from approximately 2 million people in the last fiscal year. Recipients facing these deductions can request a waiver if the overpayment was not their fault and repayment would cause financial hardship.</p>

          <p>Under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi, the U.S. Department of Justice has dismissed all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah doctor accused of a major COVID-19 vaccine fraud scheme. Moore was indicted in 2023 for allegedly destroying government-provided vaccines, administering saline shots to children, and selling fraudulent vaccination cards. In her statement, Bondi asserted that Moore "gave his patients a choice" and did not deserve prison time. The decision has been praised by figures like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, reflecting a significant shift in the administration's stance on pandemic-related regulations.</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks need to develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively explain China to the world. Speaking to a newspaper, Zheng stated that these organizations should become more "self-centred," focusing on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic frameworks. He believes this approach is crucial for accurately analyzing Chinese public policy and predicting the country's future direction. This shift, he suggests, is necessary for China to successfully project its soft power and global influence.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies relationships, couples in the happiest partnerships practice five key habits during the work week that many others neglect. These include establishing a brief morning routine together, sending thoughtful check-in messages during the day, and taking individual time to decompress after work. They also prioritize a daily, distraction-free moment of "us time" and end each day with a quiet emotional check-in. The article suggests these small, intentional rituals are more important for maintaining intimacy and connection than grand weekend gestures, especially during busy periods.</p>

According to space-tracking firm COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged close-proximity operations and "appeared visually merged" for several days in early July. If confirmed, this would mark a significant achievement in autonomous satellite servicing, a capability the United States has not yet demonstrated in the same way. The event, which was reportedly monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites, underscores China's rapidly advancing space technology and capabilities.</p>
