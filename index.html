          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose steep tariffs on imports from seven countries, including 25% duties on goods from Japan and South Korea, starting August 1. The move comes as a 90-day pause on previously announced "reciprocal" tariffs is set to expire, with the administration extending the deadline to pressure trade partners into new agreements. The announcement prompted an immediate downturn in U.S. financial markets, which fell on the news of renewed trade friction.</p>

The deluge was fueled by remnant moisture from Tropical Storm Barry, which stalled over the Texas Hill Country, a region naturally prone to flash flooding. The combination of intense rainfall and geography caused the Guadalupe River to rise at an unprecedented rate, overwhelming the landscape and leading to the catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>For the second year in a row, Germany has recorded more than 2,000 deaths from illegal drug use, with a total of 2,137 fatalities in 2024. Health officials expressed particular alarm over a 14% year-on-year increase in deaths among individuals under 30. Experts attribute the high death toll in part to the increased prevalence of dangerous synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and nitazene, highlighting a growing public health crisis.</p>

          <p>Germany's industrial production rose by a surprisingly strong 1.2% in May, exceeding analysts' expectations and offering hope for an economic recovery. The growth was primarily driven by increased output in the energy and automotive sectors. This positive data suggests that Europe's largest economy may be turning a corner, providing a sign of a cyclical rebound despite persistent concerns over global trade tensions and other economic headwinds.

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there is no evidence of an incriminating "client list" related to Jeffrey Epstein, nor credible proof that he blackmailed prominent individuals. According to a memo on the findings, investigators also confirmed that Epstein died by suicide, a conclusion supported by video footage from the correctional facility. The findings directly address years of public speculation and conspiracy theories surrounding the case and Epstein's death.</p>
