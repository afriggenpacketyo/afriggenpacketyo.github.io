          <p>Top European Union officials gathered in Chisinau for the first-ever EU-Moldova summit, signaling strong support for the country's path toward membership. Discussions focused on bolstering Moldova's resilience against Russian hybrid threats, including disinformation, especially with upcoming parliamentary elections. While Moldova and Ukraine formally opened accession talks last year, progress has been stalled, partly due to Hungary's objections to Ukraine's advancement. The summit aims to reassure Moldova of the EU's commitment without alienating Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The city commission of Key West, Florida, voted 5-1 to terminate a 287(g) agreement that allows local police to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, effectively becoming a sanctuary city. Commissioner Lissette Carey, the lone dissenting vote, expressed shock and concern for public safety, arguing her colleagues disregarded state and federal law. Florida's Attorney General has threatened legal action, including removal from office, stating the vote violates a state ban on sanctuary policies. The Trump administration also criticized the move, claiming it puts residents at risk.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain the Potential Health Risks of Competitive Eating</h2>

          <p>Health experts are raising concerns about the potential short-term and long-term health consequences of competitive eating, a sport popularized by events like the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. Gastroenterologists warn that the practice can lead to a permanently stretched stomach, impaired digestion, and gastrointestinal distress. The massive intake of calories, sodium, and fat in a single sitting can also spike blood pressure and strain the kidneys. While the long-term effects are not well-studied, immediate dangers include choking, esophageal tears, and in extreme cases, death, highlighting the risks involved in the sport.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California's Los Padres National Forest, dubbed the Madre Fire, has rapidly grown to over 52,500 acres, making it the state's largest fire of 2025. The blaze has prompted evacuation orders and warnings in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. With the fire spreading from federal to state-managed lands, Cal Fire has joined the U.S. Forest Service in a unified command, deploying extensive air and ground resources to combat the flames. The fire is currently 10% contained and threatens at least 50 structures, serving as a stark reminder of wildfire danger.</p>

          <p>President Trump has drawn condemnation from Jewish advocacy groups for using the antisemitic slur "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax policy changes, Trump used the term, which originates from a villainous Jewish character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," to describe moneylenders. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," underscoring how such tropes remain entrenched. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he only understood it to mean a predatory lender.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint detailing a scam where perpetrators impersonated the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee to steal over $250,000 in cryptocurrency. The scammers used fraudulent email addresses, closely mimicking the official one, to solicit donations from victims. The complaint states that a victim, believing they were contributing to the official committee, transferred the funds in the form of USDT stablecoin. The U.S. government is now seeking the permanent seizure of the recovered funds, a portion of which was traced to a cryptocurrency exchange account in Nigeria.</p>

          <p>Russia unleashed its largest aerial attack on Kyiv since the war began, just after President Trump held separate phone calls with both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The overnight barrage involved hundreds of drones and missiles, killing at least one person and causing widespread damage. Trump reported making "no progress" in his call with Putin, while Zelenskyy described his subsequent conversation with Trump as "very important and useful," focusing on Ukraine's air defense needs. The attack underscores Russia's escalating aggression amid stalled ceasefire talks and a recent U.S. pause on weapons shipments to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Civil rights groups, including the ACLU, have filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that U.S. immigration agents in Southern California are engaging in unconstitutional racial profiling. The lawsuit claims agents are targeting people based on their appearance in raids on known hubs for Latino workers, such as hardware store parking lots and street vendor corners. Advocates argue that ambitious arrest quotas from the Trump administration are compelling agents to make arrests without the legally required "reasonable suspicion." The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, stating its operations are "highly targeted."</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to save Florida's reefs, scientists are transplanting hybrid coral fragments onto a reef in Miami that was devastated by bleaching. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami and other partners, involves crossbreeding resilient Florida corals with corals from a naturally warmer reef in Honduras. The goal is to create more "thermally tolerant" corals that can survive rising ocean temperatures. This marks the first time internationally crossbred corals have been permitted for planting in the wild, offering a potential blueprint for reef restoration across the Caribbean.</p>
