          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty in New York federal court to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot in Manhattan in December. Mangione faces a possible death sentence if convicted in the federal case, where prosecutors argue the killing was ideologically motivated by his anger toward the health insurance industry. The 26-year-old is also separately charged in New York state court with the slaying, accused of shooting Thompson as the CEO walked into a hotel for an investor event. Mangione's defense has not yet commented on the prosecution's intent to seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>President Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff held three hours of "constructive" talks in Moscow, focusing on the possibility of resuming direct talks between Russia and Ukraine. While the US has not released details, President Trump hinted at an impending deal. Ukrainian President Zelensky is urging allies to increase pressure on Russia, blaming Moscow for the failure to agree to a ceasefire proposed by the US. The US's peace plan suggests Russia keeps land it has gained, a condition more favorable to Moscow, while Ukraine seeks a full ceasefire before discussing territorial issues.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by the FBI for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest by ICE officers. The criminal complaint alleges Dugan sought to misdirect federal agents away from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was appearing before her in court for a misdemeanor battery case. Dugan is accused of escorting Flores-Ruiz out of the courtroom through a non-public exit after learning of the ICE officers' presence and administrative warrant. If convicted, Dugan could face up to six years in prison, as her attorney has stated that she protests the arrest and believes it was not made in the interests of public safety.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk secured a major legal victory that restricts compounding pharmacies from marketing or selling cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy and Ozempic. A federal judge rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to continue making copies of these drugs, upholding the FDA's determination that the shortage of semaglutide is resolved. This decision allows the FDA to target pharmacies making compounded versions of semaglutide, addressing concerns about patient safety and the lack of FDA approval for these custom-made copies. Novo Nordisk has filed over 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies to protect Americans from the health risks of illegitimate drugs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has promised to restore funding to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a landmark study on women's health, after initially announcing cuts that sparked outcry from medical experts. The WHI is a 30-year study of over 160,000 women, leading to discoveries in women's health, including cancer, hormone therapy, chronic disease, aging, and osteoporosis. Researchers expressed concerns that the initial funding cuts would disrupt ongoing data collection and bio-specimen analysis, potentially impacting future research on women's health. The decision-making process remains opaque, raising concerns that restoring funding may come at the expense of other deserving studies.</p>

Autonomous trucks weighing over 10,001 pounds would also be allowed for testing on public roads. The regulations aim to enhance public safety, foster innovation, and establish a robust framework for autonomous vehicle technology testing and deployment, requiring adherence to data-reporting requirements and standards for interactions with first responders.</p>

          <p>Despite Trump's eagerness to reach a trade agreement with China, China denies negotiations are even taking place, believing they can wait Trump out. China has several advantages, including a lesser need for American dollars compared to America's need for Chinese goods and minerals. Additionally, America's allies are hesitant to join the trade war, and the political damage is more significant for the GOP than the CCP. China's intransigence and strategic advantages suggest a potential near-total capitulation by the U.S. may be unavoidable.</p>

          <p>As collections resume on defaulted student loans, the U.S. government has broad powers to seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits. Social Security recipients may see up to 15% of their monthly benefits reduced, but must be left with at least $750 per month. Borrowers can avoid collection activity by taking steps to get out of default, such as enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation.

Despite the "incredible" achievement, Allen trailed 10-2 and was one frame away from defeat. The maximum break was Allen's second of the season and the fifth of his career, earning him a cash bonus that will be split if another player achieves the same feat in the tournament. Wakelin ultimately secured a 12-4 lead, needing just one more frame to advance to the quarter-finals.</p>

          <p>The publication of Joan Didion's therapy notes, titled "Notes to John," has ignited debate about the ethics of posthumous publication. The notes, detailing sessions with her psychiatrist from 1999 to 2003, focus on her adopted daughter Quintana's struggles with alcoholism. Didion herself had expressed reservations about publishing unfinished work. The decision to publish the notes, despite Didion's reticence and the intimate nature of the material, raises questions about respecting an author's wishes versus serving the public's interest in their work.</p>

Environmental advocates criticize the expedited procedures, arguing they will harm public land, water sources, and community input.
