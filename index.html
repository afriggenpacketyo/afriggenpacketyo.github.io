          <h2>Trump Announces Coca-Cola to Switch to Cane Sugar from Corn Syrup</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has announced that Coca-Cola agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with "REAL Cane Sugar" in its U.S. products, a move he promoted on Truth Social. The announcement aligns with some health advocates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has criticized corn syrup, though the company has not officially confirmed the specifics of the deal. Health experts, however, note that cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup have nearly identical metabolic effects, making the change largely symbolic from a public health perspective. The move is seen by some as a political strategy to score an easy win with his base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to two U.S. intelligence sources cited by CBS News, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained leg injuries during a recent Israeli strike on Iran. The reports, which align with Iranian state-run media, indicate he was escaping an emergency shaft during a Supreme National Security Council meeting when the attack occurred. It remains unclear if he was an intentional target, although Pezeshkian had previously claimed Israel attempted to assassinate him. The incident occurred during a 12-day conflict that also saw the deaths of several high-ranking Iranian commanders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the direction of President Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum toured the former Alcatraz prison to assess its feasibility for reopening as a high-security federal detention center. Bondi stated the facility could house a range of offenders, including violent criminals and undocumented immigrants, emphasizing its symbolic value for law and order. The project faces significant logistical hurdles, including the lack of power and water infrastructure and the high cost of renovation to meet modern standards. The proposal has drawn criticism from local and state officials who highlight the site's current value as a major tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is reviewing its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning all current TSA procedures and that the rules on liquid sizes might be the next major policy to change. This follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove shoes during security screening. The current 3.4-ounce liquid rule was implemented in 2006 after a foiled terrorist plot involving liquid explosives, and any changes would be facilitated by new CT scanning technology being deployed at airports.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for Donald Trump, for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The 12-0 vote occurred after all Democratic members walked out in protest, angered by the Republican-led committee's refusal to delay the vote and hear testimony from a Justice Department whistleblower. Bove faces serious allegations of unethical conduct, including claims he suggested defying court orders and pushed for a quid pro quo to drop charges against New York's mayor. His confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain due to the controversy surrounding his record.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game brought together female members of Congress from both parties to compete against a team of journalists, setting aside political divisions for a charitable cause. The event, co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz after her own diagnosis, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, which supports young adults with breast cancer. Unlike the partisan men's baseball game, this tradition emphasizes unity and has raised nearly $5 million since its inception in 2009. The game serves as a powerful symbol of collaboration and provides a personal connection for many participants affected by the disease.</p>

Among them is a new sequel to "I Know What You Did Last Summer," which attempts a self-aware, meta-humor approach but offers mixed results compared to its 1997 predecessor. Also featured is Ari Aster's "Eddington," a neo-western set during the 2020 pandemic starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, which explores political and social tensions through a dark, realist lens. Other releases reviewed are the controversial bullfighting documentary "Tardes de soledad" and two distinct LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns," each exploring unique, personal stories of love and identity.</p>

          <p>An ice core, potentially the oldest ever recovered at 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Scientists will melt the ice, drilled from deep within Antarctica, to study trapped materials like ancient dust and volcanic ash. This research aims to unlock vital information about Earth's climate history from a period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, when glacial cycles mysteriously changed. The findings could revolutionize understanding of climate change by providing data on past atmospheric conditions, potentially helping to predict our planet's future response to rising greenhouse gas levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. This cooling was partly driven by an easing in the rapid rise of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite the slowdown, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, fueling arguments for a future interest rate hike. However, concerns over potential U.S. tariffs and slowing economic growth may complicate the central bank's policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

Given Keir Starmer's pledge to tear out the "poison" of antisemitism, maintaining consistency required firm action.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. beef prices have reached record highs, with a pound of ground beef averaging $6.12 in June, driven by a historically small national cattle herd. The supply has shrunk due to years of drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them. The situation is exacerbated by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a pest outbreak and the potential impact of widespread tariffs on imported beef. Experts do not expect significant price relief soon, as rebuilding the herd would take years, even if conditions improve. (not investment advice)</p>

The controversy, fueled by a recent Wall Street Journal report of a "bawdy" letter from Trump to Epstein, has put the administration on the defensive. While Trump has dismissed the issue as a hoax and suggested releasing only "credible" material, critics and even many of his own supporters are demanding full transparency.

The sentencing memo requests credit for time served, meaning Hankison would serve no additional jail time if the judge agrees.

          <p>Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), the condition President Trump was recently diagnosed with, is a common circulatory issue affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population. It occurs when valves in the leg veins are damaged, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like varicose veins, leg swelling, and skin discoloration. According to vascular surgeons, the condition is typically not serious and is often managed with non-surgical treatments like compression stockings and lifestyle changes such as regular walking. While genetics and aging are risk factors, the condition itself is considered benign and treatable for most patients.</p>
