          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, citing air traffic controller shortages, FAA cuts, and outdated technology as key issues. The senator highlighted a recent bonus offered to air traffic controllers that excluded New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., despite their critical needs. The article reports that problems at Newark stem from a combination of staff shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily due to the disruptions, which are also impacting other major airports across the country.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua criminal gang. The New York Times article explains that the memo states the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's operations in the United States, undermining Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The release of the memo follows previous reporting by The Times and The Washington Post, which angered the Trump administration and led to a criminal leak investigation. The ACLU has requested a judge to order the Trump administration to bring back the Venezuelans for normal immigration hearings.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released from detention, asserts that President Trump "will not silence me." Mahdawi, a green card holder, was detained after a citizenship interview under a law allowing visa revocations for individuals posing "adverse foreign policy consequences." He finds the Trump administration's rationale laughable, arguing that advocating for justice and peace should not undermine U.S. policy. Mahdawi, along with other student activists, faced detention under similar grounds, alleging the risk of "adverse foreign policy consequences."</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. Most students attending accredited private schools will receive $10,000 annually, while students with disabilities may receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students will get $2,000 per year. Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to wealthier students already in private education, while supporters claim it will provide families with greater educational freedom.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contentious State Supreme Court race, rejecting efforts from the Republican challenger to discard thousands of ballots. The ruling is a victory for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who won by 734 votes after two recounts. Judge Richard E. Myers II, a Trump appointee, stated that invalidating military and overseas ballots would violate voters' due process rights. The case has tested the boundaries of post-election litigation, and experts warn it could set a precedent for future attempts to overturn elections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has led to the departure of nearly one-third of the IRS's tax auditors through March, according to a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report. This reduction in revenue agents, who audit wealthy taxpayers and corporations, could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue. While DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to various factors. The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits.</p>

          <p>A study led by Peking University finds that migratory pests from Southeast Asia, thriving under El Niño conditions, are partially driving rice yield losses in southern China. The researchers discovered that warm, humid weather during El Niño years creates favorable breeding conditions in the pest source region, while wind gusts help them migrate to southern China. The findings emphasize the need for collaborative, international pest control strategies to ensure food security in the region.</p>

          <p>Over 150 former state and federal judges have signed a letter condemning the Trump administration's escalating battles with the judiciary, calling the recent arrest of Judge Hannah C. Dugan an attempt to intimidate. Judge Dugan was arrested by F.B.I. agents on charges of obstructing immigration agents, accused of directing an undocumented immigrant to leave through a side door while agents waited to arrest him. The judges signing the letter deemed the circumstances of Judge Dugan's arrest as an effort to threaten and intimidate the state and federal judiciaries into submitting to the administration.</p>
