The S&P 500 index fell, bond yields jumped, and the dollar slipped, reflecting souring sentiment on the U.S. economy. Moody's downgrade, citing tax cut legislation and fiscal deficit concerns, added to market unease. Investors also sought refuge in gold, pushing its price up. Higher interest rate forecasts from analysts and comments from Fed officials further contributed to market turbulence, raising questions about the safe-haven status of U.S. assets.</p>

          <p>Christine Emba's guest essay in The New York Times discusses the normalization of pornography and its negative impact on society, particularly on Gen Z. The article cites a British OnlyFans creator's stunt and a 2023 report on the prevalence of pornography online to highlight the issue. It also references Sophie Gilbert's book, "Girl on Girl," which critiques the mass culture of female objectification and hyperexposure. The author argues that despite significant evidence of pornography's harmful effects, there is a reluctance to openly criticize it, especially in progressive circles, and suggests that this nonjudgmentalism comes at the expense of discernment.</p>

The US cited national security concerns for the ban, while Beijing accused Washington of "maliciously blockading and suppressing Chinese chip products and the AI industry." Analysts suggest the ban signals an expansion of the trade war beyond tariffs, with tighter tech restrictions on China.

          <p>This article discusses the skepticism among Ukrainians regarding the potential for the Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul to lead to a cease-fire. It highlights the belief that Vladimir Putin does not genuinely want to end the war and is using negotiations as a farce to avoid sanctions and weaken the U.S. Ukrainians are confident in their ability to continue fighting, adapting to a drone war and innovating in military technology. The article contrasts this with President Trump's perceived misunderstanding of Putin's motives.</p>

          <p>Transgender service members are facing difficult decisions after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to enforce its military ban. Many are choosing to leave the military rather than be forced out. Service members who identify as having gender dysphoria must begin the voluntary separation process, while those who do not self-identify will face a referral to an annual health check-up that could lead to their removal. The ban, announced in January, argues that expressing a false gender identity and receiving gender-affirming medical care are incompatible with active duty.</p>

          <p>Alison Bechdel's latest graphic novel, "Spent," explores themes of late-stage capitalism, exhaustion, and the search for happiness. The book follows Bechdel's cartoon avatar, Alison, as she navigates anxiety, writer's block, and encounters with her Trump-loving sister. Despite the presence of real-world doom, the novel culminates in a moment of calm and contentment for Alison. Bechdel's gift as an artist lies in evoking the spirit of the moment through expressions, gestures, and the dynamics between characters.</p>
