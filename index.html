          <p>A suspect identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman was arrested and faces multiple felony charges, including the use of an incendiary device, after allegedly attacking a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideology, according to officials. Eight people were hospitalized with burns, ranging in age from 52 to 88, with one victim in critical condition. The attack, which occurred on the eve of the Jewish holiday Shavuot, has been condemned as an act of antisemitism by officials like Leo Terrell, head of the antisemitism task force at the Justice Department, and has led to the cancellation of all upcoming Run for Their Lives events. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities examining the suspect's motives and the broader context of rising violence against the Jewish community. </p>

          <p>China refuted accusations from the Trump administration that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, claiming instead that the U.S. has undermined the deal's terms. Tensions escalated after the U.S. imposed export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China and announced visa revocations for Chinese students. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that these actions seriously undermine the agreement reached in Geneva, and China vowed to protect its interests. China also defended its control over rare earth exports, contradicting U.S. expectations, which signals a worsening of trade relations between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent Vox article, Eric Levitz argues that Democrats should focus more on policy than messaging, particularly regarding abundance reforms like easing zoning restrictions and environmental review laws. He contends that while populist rhetoric may be more politically resonant, the material benefits of abundance policies are more important for the party's long-term success. Levitz points to governance failures in blue states, such as housing shortages and infrastructure project delays, as evidence that Democrats need to prioritize policies that deliver tangible results. He suggests that Democrats can pursue both abundance liberalism and populism without inherent conflict, as policies that increase economic growth can provide more wealth to redistribute.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as the new president of Poland, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. This marks a significant turnaround from initial exit polls that had predicted Trzaskowski's victory. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda and support traditional Catholic and family values. He supports continued assistance for Ukraine but opposes the country joining NATO and the EU during Russia's ongoing aggression. The result is likely to re-energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition, giving them renewed belief they will be able to defeat Tusk's coalition in 2027 parliamentary elections.</p>

Musk had called the report a lie on X, but executives knew the project had been halted in favor of focusing on robotaxis. This internal conflict highlights Tesla's challenges in delivering a low-cost, mass-market EV, which Musk had previously touted as essential to the company's future.

The three-year program, which started soon after chemotherapy, aimed to get people doing at least double the amount of exercise recommended for the general population. After five years, 80% of people exercising remained cancer-free, compared to 74% in the group given only health advice. Researchers are investigating whether similar exercise regimes could improve survival for people with other diseases, such as breast cancer, with the results potentially changing how colon cancer is treated worldwide.</p>

          <h2>Parents of Covid Vaccine Trial Volunteers Push Back Against Changing Vaccine Rules</h2>

          <p>Parents whose children participated in Covid vaccine clinical trials are expressing anger and dismay over the Trump administration's contemplation of new clinical trials for Covid boosters and moves to restrict Covid vaccines for children. These parents, including Sophia Bessias and Katherine Matthias, feel that the contributions of their children are being ignored and discarded. They worry that changing recommendations could affect doctors’ and parents’ understanding of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, potentially limiting access for those who want them. They also question the ethics of subjecting children to placebo-controlled trials when the benefits of the vaccines are already well-established.</p>

          <p>Several National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices along the hurricane-prone Gulf of Mexico coast are understaffed as the U.S. enters an expected active hurricane season. Fifteen regional weather service offices lack meteorologists, including those in Miami, Jacksonville, Puerto Rico, and Houston. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is also short five specialists. These staffing shortages, resulting from job cuts and a hiring freeze imposed by the Trump administration, raise concerns about the ability to provide detailed, localized forecasts and respond effectively to potential disasters, as the weather service has scrambled to fill gaps with temporary secondments from other offices.</p>

          <p>Katrina vanden Heuvel critiques President Trump's budget bill, arguing that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy while harming the poor and significantly increasing the national deficit. The bill includes tax cuts for the top 1% of wage earners and substantial cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and Snap, which would leave millions without healthcare or food assistance. She argues that this reflects a pattern of Republican hypocrisy, combining reckless militarism with rampant corporatism. She also contends that the bill shamelessly enriches the already mega-rich, while decreasing the earnings of those who can least afford it.</p>

Despite the call for change, the author acknowledges that 'chic' is deeply ingrained and likely to persist.

Two proposals are advancing rapidly: one would exempt most urban housing developments from CEQA, and the other would weaken the rules for most other projects. These changes would be the most profound to CEQA in generations. The effort reflects a growing narrative that CEQA has become a barrier to housing and infrastructure projects, though opponents argue it restricts community input and protects against environmental damage.

This change comes amid persistently low reading scores in the state. Several districts, including Los Angeles Unified and Long Beach Unified, have already started to embrace more structured phonics learning, and are beginning to see improvements in test scores.</p>

They cite the current administration's undermining of agency independence and President Trump's personal involvement in the crypto market as reasons for concern. The legislation, they say, needs to prescribe specific regulatory guardrails to ensure that regulators act in the public's best interest and address the risks of crime and money laundering.

The proposed regulations oversimplify complex conditions and exceed current scientific knowledge, potentially aggravating fire danger without complementary home hardening measures.
