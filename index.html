        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Conservative party has announced a plan to remove all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea if they win the next election. The policy, which focuses on "maximising extraction," marks a significant shift from the UK's legally binding 2050 net zero target and contrasts with the Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses. The move has drawn criticism from environmental groups and opposition parties, who label it as "reckless environmental vandalism" that will not lower energy bills and will worsen the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>Multiple beaches across the United States are under swimming advisories for the Labor Day weekend due to high levels of fecal bacteria in the water. Destinations from Florida to Maine, as well as parts of California and Hawaii, have been affected, with health officials warning that the contamination can cause gastrointestinal illnesses and rashes. A recent report from Environment America found that 61% of U.S. beaches tested experienced at least one day of potentially unsafe fecal contamination, attributing the issue to polluted runoff, failing sewer systems, and industrial livestock operations.</p>

          <p>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the former chief of immunizations at the CDC, has expressed grave concern over the direction of U.S. public health following his resignation. He stated that under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the "firewall between science and ideology has completely broken down," leading to politically driven decisions like limiting the new COVID-19 vaccine to high-risk groups. Daskalakis warned that this ideological shift threatens to undo progress in vaccination and public trust, a sentiment echoed by former acting CDC Director Dr. Richard Besser, who fears for the country's readiness for future health emergencies.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore stated he has "no interest in fighting with the president" but will continue to advocate for his communities amid a public dispute with President Trump over crime in Baltimore. Trump has repeatedly criticized the city, calling it a "hellhole" and threatening to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore dismissed as "performative." While acknowledging Baltimore's challenges, Moore highlighted recent progress in reducing crime and argued for increased federal funding for local law enforcement rather than a military presence, which he deems an unserious approach to municipal policing.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned reports of the Trump administration's plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential deployment an "invasion." Pritzker asserted that the move is not about fighting crime but is a political maneuver by President Trump, possibly aimed at disrupting future elections. He argued that such an action is an unconstitutional attack on state sovereignty and would inflame local tensions, contrasting it with the productive collaboration that could occur if the administration instead provided more civilian law enforcement resources like FBI and ATF agents.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, who recently turned 80, has released a new album of re-recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival hits after a decades-long battle to regain control of his song catalog. After the band's breakup in 1972, Fogerty lost the rights to his own compositions, a painful experience that led him to stop performing them for many years. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he eventually bought back the rights and recorded "Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)" with his sons, allowing him to finally present his iconic songs like "Proud Mary" as he intended.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move expected to support thousands of UK jobs and hundreds of businesses. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian frigates designed to operate jointly in the North Atlantic, enhancing capabilities to monitor Russian submarine activity and protect critical infrastructure.</p>

A successful maneuver to gain control over the board could grant the administration power over interest rates, bank regulations, and the stability of the U.S. financial system. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, financial experts and legal scholars warn that politicizing the Fed could undermine its credibility, potentially leading to economic instability and loss of confidence in the dollar.

          <p>The recent release of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview transcripts by the Department of Justice has drawn criticism for the apparent failure to press her on key details, including hints about Jeffrey Epstein's connections to Trump administration officials. During the interview, Maxwell suggested some of Epstein's associates were in the president's cabinet, but the deputy US attorney did not ask for names. Critics and attorneys for survivors of Epstein's abuse argue that this, along with a lack of outreach to victims, indicates the disclosures are more performative than a genuine pursuit of accountability.</p>

          <p>A critical opinion piece argues that many of President Trump's decisions stem from profound ignorance rather than political ideology, citing his dangerous and factually incorrect order to release reservoir water to fight California wildfires as a prime example. The article suggests that Trump often acts on whims or conspiracy theories from informal advisors, ignoring experts and demonstrating a lack of understanding of basic science and economics. This tendency, which was evident in his first term, continues in his second, posing significant risks to the country's safety and economic stability.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the little-known origins of surfing on the U.S. mainland. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—who were attending a nearby military school, fashioned surfboards from local redwood and introduced the sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their demonstration of what was then a royal Hawaiian tradition captivated locals and planted the seeds for a culture that would eventually sweep the nation, long before it was popularized globally in the 20th century.</p>

          <p>Analysts in mainland China have expressed concern that potential joint weapons production between the United States and Taiwan could threaten regional stability. The warning comes after U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated during a visit to Taipei that he expects such cooperation to move forward. For decades, the U.S. has sold arms to the self-governing island, but co-production would mark a significant escalation in defense ties, a move that would likely be viewed by Beijing as a major provocation.</p>

          <p>A trend of imposing new taxes on high-value second homes is gaining momentum in several U.S. states, sparking a debate over fairness and economic impact. Rhode Island's new surcharge, nicknamed the "Taylor Swift Tax," targets non-primary residences valued over $1 million, a move brokers argue unfairly penalizes seasonal residents who contribute significantly to local economies without using many public services. Similar measures have been passed in Montana, while other localities like Cape Cod are considering new transfer taxes, as governments seek new revenue streams amid populist anger over housing affordability.

          <p>Jennifer Abruzzo, the former general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), warns that the Trump administration's actions are severely undermining the agency's ability to protect workers' rights. Since taking office, President Trump has fired key officials, including the NLRB chair, leaving the board without a quorum and unable to issue decisions, effectively paralyzing its enforcement capabilities. Abruzzo fears these moves, combined with corporate legal challenges to the NLRB's constitutionality, could return labor rights to pre-1935 levels and empower corporations to violate labor laws with impunity.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece delves into the common modern dilemma of feeling guilty for personal happiness while the world faces numerous humanitarian and political crises. The author draws on philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, suggesting it is natural to feel the pain of others. However, the essay argues that this connection should also extend to sharing in the world's joys, a concept known as "sympathetic joy." The author concludes that allowing oneself to feel both horror and delight is not a contradiction but a necessary part of human resistance and well-being.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to "fix" the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), raising concerns among experts that his changes could destabilize the vaccine market and harm patients. The VICP was created to compensate individuals for rare vaccine side effects while shielding manufacturers from extensive litigation, ensuring a stable vaccine supply. Critics fear that altering or abolishing the program, as some anti-vaccine advocates have proposed, could lead manufacturers to exit the market and make it harder for those with legitimate injuries to receive compensation.</p>
