          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 22 years for attempting to murder a colleague, Graeme Perks. Brooks broke into Perks's home in 2021, armed with a crowbar, petrol, and a knife, due to a grievance related to disciplinary proceedings where Perks was a witness. Perks sustained life-threatening injuries from the attack but survived due to swift medical intervention. The case was delayed by Brooks's attempts to obstruct court proceedings, with authorities praising the Perks family for their resilience during the prolonged legal process.</p>

California is a donor state, contributing significantly more in taxes to the federal government than it receives in return. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that such a boycott would constitute criminal tax evasion. The dispute highlights the escalating tensions between California and the federal government over immigration and financial policies. (not investment advice)</p>
