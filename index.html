          <p>Operation Remount Corporation in Jay Em, Wyoming, is using equine therapy to help veterans struggling with mental health issues, pairing them with wild mustangs. Many of the mustangs have also experienced trauma, creating a reciprocal healing environment. Veteran Sean Walker, a participant in the program, says working with his horse, Spirit, has significantly impacted his reintegration into civilian life after serving multiple tours in Iraq and Bosnia. The program includes a six-week course and allows veterans to keep the horses, aiming to combat PTSD, depression, and anxiety prevalent among veterans.</p>

          <p>As Japan's population ages, an increasing number of childless seniors are opting for bequest donations to hospitals, nonprofits, and other entities after their death. This trend is driven by the rise in childless couples and unmarried individuals with no heirs. Organizations are now acting as intermediaries between donors and recipients through wills and trusts. The amount of money going into the national treasury due to the absence of inheritors has been rising, prompting greater awareness of bequest donations among those without heirs.</p>

Facing low public support due to slush fund scandals, Ishiba initially hesitated to oust the minister but eventually did so to limit damage before a looming parliamentary election. He appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister, gambling on his popularity to restore public confidence.
