          <p>President Trump announced a "first Phase" peace deal between Israel and Hamas, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed-upon line in Gaza. This agreement, confirmed by regional sources and Hamas, is slated for Israeli cabinet approval on Thursday, with hostage releases potentially beginning 48-72 hours later. The two-year conflict, sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, has led to immense casualties, with over 67,000 Palestinian deaths reported by Gaza's health ministry. Trump hailed the deal as a significant step towards lasting peace for the region and the U.S., crediting Qatari, Egyptian, and Turkish mediators for their efforts in this complex negotiation. This initial phase aims to de-escalate tensions and pave the way for further discussions on the conflict's broader resolution.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick's inaugural season as North Carolina's head football coach is reportedly in jeopardy, with the team holding a 2-3 record. Both the university and Belichick are weighing buyout options, including a substantial $20 million university buyout that could be reduced by alleged rules violations, or Belichick's own $1 million buyout if he finds another team or media role. Off-field drama, such as a coach's suspension for allegedly giving extra benefits to players and a lawsuit challenging Belichick's hiring, further complicates the situation. A planned Hulu docuseries following his college football journey was also reportedly scrapped due to the team's poor start, highlighting significant dysfunction within the program.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "revenge crusade" is dramatically escalating, driven by his fixation on how his felony conviction will be remembered. He recently demanded the jailing of Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson without evidence of crimes, coinciding with the arraignment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements to Congress. This signals a breakdown of normal barriers between the White House and the Justice Department, with Trump's wishes for punishment now being acted upon. Aides initially downplayed the vengeance talk, but Trump's focus shifted to retaliation after political setbacks and personal humiliations.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon Press Association states that negotiations with the Defense Department over new press credential restrictions have reached an impasse, despite some concessions. Reporters are still required to affirm their "understanding" of policies that the Association believes are designed to stifle a free press and could expose journalists to prosecution for using unauthorized, unclassified sources. The new policy also threatens to relocate news organizations from their dedicated workspaces, a move feared to hinder communication with sources. The Association views these measures as an unprecedented message of intimidation, while the Pentagon maintains it has negotiated in good faith and is only asking reporters to confirm understanding of information handling policies.</p>

This strategic move aims to further expand SoftBank's footprint in Artificial Intelligence, aligning with founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI" and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. The deal, which requires regulatory approval, means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business. This acquisition highlights SoftBank's continued focus on AI investments, including its ownership of Arm and a stake in OpenAI, positioning itself at the forefront of the AI boom.

          <p>President Trump's 20-point peace plan for the Israel-Hamas war, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, outlines an immediate end to fighting and phased Israeli withdrawals from Gaza. The plan mandates Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for 250 Palestinian life-sentence prisoners and 1,700 other detainees. It also calls for Gaza's demilitarization, overseen by independent monitors, and governance by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" rather than Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. The proposal emphasizes full aid to Gaza and economic redevelopment, while offering a vague "credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood."</p>

Both Pritzker and Johnson have condemned the move as an "invasion" and "unhinged," fearing racial profiling and asserting that federal agents make communities less safe. The legality of these deployments faces scrutiny in federal courts, as Trump and his advisors assert "plenary authority" to bypass local objections, escalating tensions over executive power.</p>

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner praised defender Maya Le Tissier, calling her a "rock" for the team after her match-winning penalty in their Champions League debut. Despite her consistent performance and a record 71st consecutive WSL appearance, Le Tissier has only eight international caps, with England coach Sarina Wiegman preferring her at right-back rather than her club position of centre-back. With key England defenders like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze injured, Le Tissier's strong club form, topping WSL rankings for clearances and touches, has fueled calls for her inclusion in the national squad, with Wiegman set to announce her next squad soon. Skinner believes she will be an "incredible England stalwart."</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. has renewed contracts for film chiefs Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy, marking a significant reversal of fortune after a challenging period. Six months prior, the co-chairs faced uncertainty due to underperforming films, but a string of recent box office hits, including "A Minecraft Movie," "Sinners," and "Superman," propelled the studio past $4 billion globally for the first time since 2019. CEO David Zaslav credited their leadership for the improved performance and a balanced slate of blockbusters, intellectual property adaptations, horror, and original works.

          <p>Britain's membership in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) has become a contentious political issue, with the Conservative Party, led by Kemi Badenoch, pledging to withdraw if they win the next election. This stance, aimed at curbing illegal immigration and protecting borders, contrasts sharply with Liberal Democrat opposition and Labour's nuanced position. The ECHR, drafted with British input, has faced increasing criticism for perceived overreach, particularly regarding immigration cases and judicial interpretations that some argue compromise UK sovereignty. Experts debate the actual impact of withdrawal on immigration and broader human rights, noting the complexity beyond political soundbites.</p>

          <p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, warned of a higher risk for a serious US stock market fall within the next six months to two years, stating he is "far more worried than others." Dimon cited geopolitical instability, fiscal spending, and global remilitarization as key uncertainties, suggesting the market's rapid growth, partly driven by AI investments, might be overheated. He acknowledged that while AI is real and will ultimately pay off, much of the current investment could be lost. Dimon also commented on US reliability on the world stage and a potential trade breakthrough with India. (not investment advice)</p>

This account contrasts with Russian President Vladimir Putin's claim that Moscow's forces hold the strategic initiative. Zelenskiy also noted "difficult" conditions around Novopavlivka in Zaporizhzhia but reported good results from active defensive actions. Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, claimed control of Novohryhorivka in southern Zaporizhzhia, while governors in Kherson and Sumy regions reported three civilian deaths each from Russian attacks, highlighting ongoing intense fighting across the frontlines.</p>

          <p>This article criticizes the growing trend of American politicians using profanity in public, citing examples from Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, as well as President Trump. The author argues that while swearing can be cathartic and even a sign of intelligence when used strategically, its frequent and casual deployment by elected officials diminishes its impact and makes them appear inauthentic and "not cool." The piece laments the vulgarization of political culture, urging leaders to model better behavior and uphold a sense of decorum, rather than attempting to feign edginess through constant profanity.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project during a meeting in Washington. Carney raised the pipeline in the context of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, with Trump reportedly receptive to the idea. The project, which would connect Alberta to the US, was previously blocked by the Obama and Biden administrations and abandoned by its owner, TC Energy (now South Bow), after permits were canceled. The discussion, described as preliminary, suggests renewed interest despite past opposition from environmentalists and indigenous groups, and the company's prior statement of having "moved on."</p>

He argued that large technology companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are genuinely purchasing AI cloud infrastructure due to high demand, representing a "fundamental infrastructure buildout." CoreWeave, which went public in March and has seen its stock soar over 200%, recently expanded its contracts with OpenAI to $22.4 billion and inked a $14.2 billion deal with Meta. Intrator asserts that partnerships during massive infrastructure expansions are normal, predicting the "circular investment" narrative will pass. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York City administrative judge dismissed a civil summons against writer Alex O’Keefe, formerly of “The Bear,” for alleged disorderly conduct stemming from a viral NYC train incident. O’Keefe, who is Black, was detained last month after an "old white woman" complained about his seating. He alleged he was "harassed and detained for sitting while Black," and that police arrested him without speaking to the complainant. Police stated he was not arrested but issued a summons for occupying two seats and refusing directions, delaying service. The judge deemed the charges "facially insufficient," leading to a complete dismissal of the case.</p>
