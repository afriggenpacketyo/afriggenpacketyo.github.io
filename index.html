        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has dismissed their manager, Ange Postecoglou, a mere 16 days after he guided the team to a Europa League victory. This win, a 1-0 triumph over Manchester United, marked Tottenham's first major trophy in 17 years, yet it occurred amidst a dismal Premier League season where they finished 17th. Postecoglou had expressed optimism for the future, but his tenure ended abruptly, exactly two years after his arrival from Celtic. Potential replacements include Brentford's Thomas Frank and former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino, now managing the United States. The team will likely be searching for a manager to help them get back on their feet after a tough season. Optimism is low for the team given the unexpected change in leadership.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a roughly 5% climb following a $152 billion drop in market capitalization fueled by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest Tesla's investor base remains unconcerned by the drama, while others speculated on a potential truce brokered by Trump, which a White House official denied interest in. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures. The market may be volatile as it responds to the news, but some analysts believe that the stock is oversold. (not investment advice)</p>

The memo, issued by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the National Counterterrorism Center, highlights concerns that some individuals online are sharing the manifesto of the alleged Capital Jewish Museum attacker and calling for additional violence. Law enforcement agencies advise security partners to remain vigilant for threats of targeted violence against Jewish and Israeli communities, emphasizing the influence of online messaging from foreign terrorist organizations.

          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is attempting to maintain focus on the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" amidst a public feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Musk has criticized the bill, urging Congress to reject it, while Trump has stated that Musk has "lost his mind." Johnson, who previously had a close relationship with Musk, is trying to avoid getting involved in the conflict and emphasizes the importance of accomplishing their legislative agenda. Other House Republicans are weighing in on whether Musk's influence could impact the bill's passage, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sees the clash as a potential opportunity to defeat the bill. It is unclear if this feud will negatively affect the passing of the bill.</p>

          <p>An auditors' report obtained by the BBC has revealed a "pervasive fraud environment" at Unite, one of the UK's largest trade unions, alongside a Â£53.8m financial hit related to a Birmingham hotel project. The BDO report, commissioned by Unite's general secretary Sharon Graham, cites "unusual relationships" between former senior staff and the union's customers and suppliers, as well as a culture that did not challenge financial transactions. Ms. Graham has vowed to uncover the truth about alleged corruption related to the Birmingham hotel project and take steps to prevent future occurrences.

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to lift a court order that reinstated U.S. Department of Education employees who were terminated as part of efforts to dismantle the agency. Officials argue that a U.S. District Judge in Boston lacked the authority to require the Education Department to rehire the workers. The staff reduction, affecting over 1,300 employees, is intended to streamline the Department and eliminate discretionary functions better left to the States. A federal appeals court had previously refused to lift the judge's ruling, and the administration continues to push for the layoffs.</p>

The S&P 500 rebounded due to a positive nonfarm payrolls report, indicating the U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2% and hourly wages up 3.9%. This report eased investor concerns following suboptimal labor market reports, suggesting the labor market didn't collapse last month.

Retail prices have not fallen as quickly as wholesale prices, and while tariffs on new imported vehicles do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices and demand affect the used car market. Demand has stayed relatively strong due to low inventory levels, and consumers have been holding onto their vehicles longer.</p>

          <p>The author discusses the public dispute between Elon Musk and Donald Trump, describing it as a "reality TV dispute" and questioning the notion of "phallocentric" communication. The author suggests that their behavior is more akin to passive-aggressive and female-coded interactions seen in reality television shows. This style of masculinity rejects traditional notions of being a provider or moral exemplar, replacing it with disruption and edgelord posturing without accountability. The author views this trend as toxic immaturity and expresses concern for the state of masculinity.</p>

          <p>Employers across the U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding economists' expectations and signaling a steady labor market despite economic headwinds from tariffs. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2% for the third consecutive month, matching forecasts. Health care and the leisure and hospitality industry saw the largest gains, while federal employment declined. While the report topped expectations, job growth was slightly weaker compared to previous months, and some economists warn of a potential slowdown in the coming months.

          <p>While Labour won the Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse by-election, Reform UK emerged as another significant winner, finishing third behind the SNP with their best-ever parliamentary election result in Scotland. The party's deputy leader, Richard Tice, hailed the result as a "massive boost" for the upcoming 2026 vote. The SNP and Labour both lost vote share, with the SNP facing greater consequences due to being in power for the last 18 years. The Conservatives finished a distant fourth, struggling to counter the rise of Reform. The election outcome may alter the prevailing narrative in Scottish politics.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) suggests that maintenance errors may have contributed to an American Airlines plane fire at Denver International Airport in March. Investigators found loose and incorrectly installed parts in the plane's engine, leading to fuel leaks. Passengers reported chaos in the cabin, with some evacuating to the wing after an escape slide jammed. The NTSB is investigating the incident, which resulted in minor injuries to twelve people, and American Airlines is cooperating with the investigation.

          <p>The article discusses President Donald Trump's latest travel ban, which restricts travelers from several countries, and notes the muted public response compared to the protests that erupted in 2017. The author argues that Americans have become habituated to a president who wields his power with discriminatory intentions. The ban is seen as furthering a demographic-engineering project intended to exclude immigrants whom the president finds undesirable. The author suggests that the logic behind the ban is arbitrary and that it reflects Trump's preference for immigrants from certain ethno-religious backgrounds.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that fecal microbial transplants (FMTs), a method hailed for restoring gut microbiomes, may carry unintended health risks. Researchers found that mismatches between donor fecal matter and the recipient's gut environment could have negative consequences on immune and metabolic function. The study, conducted on mice, human tissue samples, and a small volunteer group, indicates that FMTs may introduce microbes that hijack the host environment, potentially leading to new health issues. The authors recommend greater care in designing fecal transplants, using specific, targeted microbes for the intestines to reduce the risk of adverse effects.</p>
