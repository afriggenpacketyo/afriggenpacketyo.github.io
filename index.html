        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates after the April jobs report exceeded expectations, continuing his pattern of attempting to influence the central bank's decisions. Trump has previously criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but has recently softened his stance, though he still believes he understands interest rates better. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payrolls increased by 177,000 in April, surpassing estimates, which led to a rise in stock futures. Trump contrasted his current message with his earlier criticism of President Biden for negative GDP numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

The event, hosted by Anna Wintour, will be co-chaired by Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, and Pharrell Williams, with a host committee including Janelle Monae and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

          <p>Chevron plans to reduce the pace of its share buybacks due to declining oil prices, which have impacted the oil major's first-quarter profit. U.S. crude oil prices have decreased due to President Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ production plans, leading to concerns about demand. Chevron will repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its stock in the second quarter, a decrease from the $3.9 billion in the first quarter, but the overall repurchase guidance for the year remains at $10 to $20 billion. Chevron's net income fell by over 30% to $3.5 billion.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his legal challenge to reinstate automatic police protection during visits to the U.K., following a judge's ruling on Friday. Harry's security status will remain as is, with state-funded protection provided on a case-by-case basis. The legal challenge stemmed from a 2020 decision by the U.K. government to deny his family automatic taxpayer-funded police protection after he and his wife stepped down as senior working royals. Harry's lawyers argued that his security risk remains high, citing threats from al-Qaeda, but the judge found no legal basis to challenge the government's decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates, though profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the impact of weaker oil prices. CEO Darren Woods described the market as "choppy," noting that demand was strong but higher supply depressed prices, and that Trump's tariffs have raised uncertainty about future demand. Exxon's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, driven by growth in the Permian and Guyana.</p>

As a result, prices are expected to increase, and some options may become unavailable.
