          <p>Nvidia's substantial $100 billion investment in OpenAI, announced recently, will largely be allocated to leasing Nvidia's advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI supercomputing facilities.

The gunman, Joshua Jahn, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and ammunition recovered bore "ANTI-ICE" messages, indicating an ideological motive. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons stated the attack was indiscriminate and could have been deadlier, emphasizing that ICE operations will not be deterred.

          <p>Africa is experiencing a record surge in solar capacity, driven by the influx of Chinese-made solar panels, with imports reaching 9,516 megawatts in the first seven months of this year. This growth is attributed to falling costs and massive energy plants developed by Chinese firms, notably in South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria. The trend signifies Africa's rapid adoption of renewable energy and China's dominant role in global solar technology production, rewiring the continent for a sustainable future.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck west and north Venezuela on Wednesday, with its epicenter located near Mene Grande, an oil town in Zulia state. Despite shaking buildings and causing alarm in cities like Caracas and Maracaibo, there were no immediate reports of casualties or serious damage. Strong tremors are not common in Venezuela, a country with the world's largest proven crude oil reserves. The quake was also felt in neighboring Colombia and several Caribbean islands.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring financial support options for companies within Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, which are facing severe strain after a cyber-attack halted JLR car production since late August. Ideas include the government purchasing component parts to keep suppliers afloat or providing government-backed loans. This intervention aims to prevent bankruptcies among smaller firms heavily reliant on JLR, as the cyber-attack is estimated to cost the company at least £50 million weekly in lost production.
