          <p>England football defender Jess Carter has announced she will be taking a step back from social media due to experiencing significant racial abuse throughout the Euro 2025 tournament. In a statement, the 27-year-old athlete clarified that while she accepts fan opinions on performance, she does not believe it is acceptable to target someone's race or appearance. In a related move, the Lionesses team stated they will no longer take a knee before matches, indicating a need for new methods to combat racism. The Football Association is reportedly working with police to identify and prosecute those responsible for the hate crime.</p>

          <p>Following a tragic coach crash in Somerset, four individuals—two children and two adults—are still receiving hospital care. The incident occurred when a coach carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School went off the road and slid down a 20-foot slope, resulting in the death of a 10-year-old boy. A major incident was declared, and the coach was recovered from the scene as part of the ongoing police investigation into the crash on the A396 Cutcombe Hill. The local community has shown strong support, raising over £40,000 through fundraisers to assist the victims and their families.</p>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, has doubled down on his demand for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the late Jeffrey Epstein. Speaking on Sunday, Burchett emphasized the need for transparency but also cautioned that the identities of victims and innocent individuals mentioned in the files should be protected. He pushed back against former President Trump's initial dismissal of the effort as a "hoax," while acknowledging Trump's subsequent directive to Attorney General Pam Bondi to unseal grand jury evidence as a positive first step. Burchett expressed skepticism that the full truth would ever be revealed, citing Washington's tendency to keep secrets.</p>

          <p>WNBA stars used the All-Star Game as a platform to call for increased salaries amid contentious collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations with the league. Players, including the sidelined Caitlin Clark, wore warm-up shirts with the message "Pay Us What You Owe Us" to highlight their demands. The players argue that the league's booming business, including a new $2.2 billion media rights deal and high expansion fees, justifies a significant pay increase. Despite the public pressure, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert expressed optimism that a "transformational" new agreement will be reached before the current CBA expires on October 31.</p>

          <p>Exit polls from Japan's upper house election indicate that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition is poised to lose its majority, placing him under significant political pressure. Having already lost control of the more powerful lower house, this defeat would severely weaken his administration's ability to govern effectively and could lead to his resignation. Public frustration over rising inflation, a cost-of-living crisis, and a series of political scandals have eroded support for the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner. The outcome could destabilize Japan's government during a critical period of trade negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in psychology suggest that personality traits, once thought to be fixed, can be intentionally redesigned. The article profiles writer Olga Khazan, who, dissatisfied with her anxious and introverted nature, embarked on a year-long journey to change her personality by actively stepping outside her comfort zone through activities like improv comedy. University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala's research supports this, indicating that consciously altering one's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors over time can lead to fundamental shifts in personality. This approach, detailed in Khazan's book "Me, But Better," offers a new perspective on mental health and personal development beyond traditional therapy.</p>

Conversely, Johnson is most impressed by candidates who can openly discuss mistakes or challenges they've faced and explain how they solved problems under pressure.

Congress has pushed back, with the House Armed Services Committee voting to block the move. To circumvent the law, Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed after different historical soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes, a move critics call disingenuous.

The author recounts personal experiences with sanitized state history lessons, such as re-enacting land runs that ignore the displacement of Indigenous nations. The piece explores how the state, from its 'Boomer' and 'Sooner' mythology to the vision of all-Black towns, has been a testing ground for American ideals and contradictions. It concludes that Oklahoma's story of ambition, betrayal, and the collision of dreams offers an unvarnished portrait of America's complex and often violent inheritance.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it targets more than just dangerous criminals. This shift has contributed to a drop in his approval among Hispanic Americans. The poll also indicates that most Americans, feeling the strain of inflation, want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on issues like tariffs or deportation. While Trump's base remains strongly supportive, his overall approval has slipped as independents and Democrats express growing doubt about his priorities and the effects of his policies, such as the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."</p>

The high cost of living is cited as a major factor, as most of the top 10 cities are in states where retirement savings of over $1 million are considered necessary for comfort. For example, the analysis suggests needing around $1.3 million to retire in New York and $1.6 million in California. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece contrasts the ideals of the civics test—which asks about the Constitution and the rule of law—with the current political reality where such principles feel threatened.

The article explains that common parental responses, like dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them that their feelings are invalid, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem. To foster this crucial skill, parents are advised to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves without judgment, and model their own emotional regulation.

A Georgia judge determined the private foundation was subject to the state's Open Records Act, setting a potential precedent for police foundations nationwide, which are often used to fund police activities without public scrutiny. The released documents reveal the APF's active lobbying efforts to prevent a public referendum on the project.

Key actions include gutting tax credits for wind and solar projects, promoting coal, and proposing budget cuts that would shutter key NOAA climate research labs.

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, known for treating diabetes and obesity, could be a breakthrough for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder. Many women with PCOS, which can cause irregular periods, infertility, and weight gain, have reported significant symptom improvement after using these medications. Researchers believe the drugs' effectiveness stems from their ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss, which in turn helps regulate hormones like testosterone. While larger clinical trials are needed and insurance coverage remains a barrier, the initial results offer hope for a condition that has seen few new treatments in decades.</p>

          <p>A new White House executive order on "Restoring Gold Standard Science" is being criticized as a tool to undermine scientific evidence that conflicts with political goals. The policy gives political appointees the power to define scientific integrity, allowing them to cast doubt on inconvenient findings by demanding unattainable levels of certainty. This article argues the strategy echoes the "doubt science" pioneered by the tobacco industry to delay regulation. By elevating uncertainty, the administration can weaken the scientific basis for public health and environmental protections, such as those for PFAS "forever chemicals," effectively shaping science to fit policy rather than the other way around.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of several districts in Deir al-Balah, a crowded area in central Gaza that has not previously been the site of a major ground offensive. The directive has caused widespread panic among the tens of thousands of residents and displaced Palestinians sheltering there. It has also raised fears for the families of Israeli hostages, as it is suspected that Hamas may be holding captives in the city. The new orders come as health officials report dozens of casualties from Israeli fire near aid distribution points, and the UN continues to warn that civilians are starving.</p>

          <p>A series of five powerful earthquakes, the largest registering a magnitude of 7.4, struck in the Pacific Ocean near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on Sunday. The quakes prompted initial tsunami warnings for the Russian coast and a tsunami watch for Hawaii. However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later confirmed that the danger had passed, and Russia's Emergencies Ministry also lifted its warning. The largest tremor occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 20 kilometers, about 144 kilometers east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Health agencies are warning of an increased risk of Vibrio bacterial infections in European coastal waters, particularly in the Baltic, North, and Black Seas. These naturally occurring bacteria thrive in warmer, low-salinity water, and climate change is creating more favorable conditions for their growth. Vibriosis can cause serious illness, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems, and is typically contracted by eating raw shellfish or swimming with open wounds. While infections remain relatively rare, European environmental and health agencies have noted that recent marine heatwaves have led to unprecedented levels of vibriosis cases, highlighting a growing public health concern.</p>

          <p>Amid conservative backlash to the idea of Superman as an immigrant, this article explores the character's leftist origins with Grant Morrison, author of the influential "All-Star Superman" comic series. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and landlords, acting as a socialist figure. Morrison explains how the character evolved over the decades, becoming a patriotic symbol during WWII, a suburban family man in the 1950s, and a cosmic seeker in the 1960s. This history reveals a character far more radical than modern interpretations often suggest, making him a timeless and adaptable metaphor.</p>

However, the study raises concerns, as a third of teens have discussed serious matters with AI instead of people, and another third have felt uncomfortable with an AI's response.
