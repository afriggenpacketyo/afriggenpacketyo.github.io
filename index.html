          <p>A Dutch children's book, intended to celebrate Amsterdam's diversity for the city's 750th anniversary, has faced backlash from the Chinese community for containing a game that reinforces negative stereotypes. The game instructs players to move back spaces if they land on a square depicting Chinese tourists blocking a bike lane, which critics say promotes racism in children's language. The controversy led to protests and calls for greater awareness of anti-Asian discrimination, with the Amsterdam mayor and publisher expressing regret and promising corrective action, including distributing stickers to amend the book's content. This incident highlights the ongoing struggle against anti-Asian racism and the importance of addressing stereotypes in educational materials, with social media playing a key role in mobilizing the Chinese community and amplifying their voices.</p>

As a result, a growing number of builders are cutting prices to address affordability concerns and entice hesitant buyers.

          <p>A large-scale Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv resulted in the deaths of 15 people, including a U.S. citizen, and injured over 150 others.

The intensified aerial assaults coincide with a Russian summer offensive in eastern and northeastern Ukraine, placing further strain on Ukrainian forces and resources. Amidst escalating tensions, Ukraine has urged its citizens to leave Israel and Iran, and Zelenskyy is seeking increased support from Western partners to counter Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of women are embracing strength training, challenging traditional beauty standards that have long prioritized thinness. Three new books explore this phenomenon, examining the cultural symbolism of muscles and the empowerment that comes with physical strength. However, the article questions whether the pursuit of a well-muscled physique could lead to new forms of body neuroses, similar to those associated with the pursuit of thinness. The piece further delves into the historical context of feminine ideals and the societal implications of women embracing strength, including how it can be seen as subversive or feminist.</p>

Around 20 million barrels of crude, condensate, and fuels are estimated to flow through the waterway daily, with a significant portion destined for Asian consumers. Any blockade or disruption could trigger a sharp spike in crude prices and negatively impact energy importers, especially in Asia, while Iran itself relies on the Strait of Hormuz to ship its oil.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down Trump administration orders that led to the cancellation of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants linked to diversity, gender identity, and vaccine hesitancy. The judge ruled that the directives were arbitrary and capricious, siding with public health groups and state attorneys general who filed lawsuits. The ruling halts the cancellation of millions of dollars already awarded and allows life-saving medical research to continue. The Department of Health and Human Services is exploring legal options, maintaining that it wants taxpayer dollars to support "gold standard science" and not "divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology."</p>
