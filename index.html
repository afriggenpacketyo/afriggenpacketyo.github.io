          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Chicago Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences for murder and federal charges. Hoover, who had already been serving a 200-year sentence for a 1973 murder, was convicted on federal charges in 1997 for leading a criminal enterprise from prison. Hoover's attorneys expressed their gratitude to President Trump for delivering justice, emphasizing Hoover's rehabilitation and growth. Despite the commutation of his federal sentence, Hoover still faces the remainder of his 200-year state sentence in Illinois. The lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial voiced disappointment, highlighting Hoover's extensive criminal activities and influence, including exploiting children in his drug operations.</p>

The couple had been serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud, with Todd receiving a 12-year sentence and Julie a 7-year sentence. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, played a key role in appealing to the Trump administration for the pardons. The Chrisleys were also ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution for their fraudulent activities, which involved providing false information to banks and fabricating financial documents. The family's story will continue with a new reality series on Lifetime, marking a new chapter after their imprisonment.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed concerns over U.S. chip controls that have effectively closed off the Chinese market to the company, leading to a multibillion-dollar writeoff on unsold inventory. Despite this, Nvidia reported a substantial 69% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong demand for its AI chips. The Trump administration's decision to require an export license for Nvidia's H20 processor, previously approved for China, has severely impacted the company's sales in the region. Huang emphasized that the $50 billion Chinese market is now largely inaccessible to U.S. industry due to these restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon heating technology. This change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, seeks to lower household bills and reduce planet-warming emissions by making heat pump installations easier, particularly for terraced homes. Consumer groups, however, caution that the upfront costs and potential need for upgrades to older housing stock remain significant barriers, especially for renters and leaseholders. The government aims to provide 300,000 households with energy efficiency upgrades through the Warm Homes Plan, but electricity costs need to be addressed to make heat pumps more economically viable.</p>

          <p>Conservative insiders are voicing concerns about Kemi Badenoch's leadership, citing recent missteps and a lack of clear policy direction as contributing to the party's struggles. The Conservative Party has experienced a decline in local council seats and a drop in polling numbers since Badenoch took over as leader. Critics argue that her decision to delay policy development has allowed Reform UK to gain traction as the de facto opposition. Some within the party are also frustrated by budget constraints and staffing shortages at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, further hindering their ability to effectively challenge the Labour government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended his trade negotiation tactics in response to the emergence of the "TACO trade" acronym, which stands for "Trump Always Chickens Out." Trump dismissed the notion that he backs down on tariff threats, arguing that his actions have helped the U.S. gain leverage in trade negotiations. He cited the European Union as an example, claiming that his tariff threats led to renewed trade talks. Trump insisted that his approach is a form of negotiation, not a sign of weakness.</p>

He described the Trump administration’s arguments as “absurd!” and memorably wrote: “The Order shouts through a bullhorn: If you take on causes disfavored by President Trump, you will be punished!” The judge ruled in favor of the law firm WilmerHale, finding Trump's attacks on law firms unconstitutional.</p>

This impatience also affects his ability to negotiate effectively, as seen in trade talks with the EU and the handling of the war in Ukraine.
