        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rapper Lil Nas X, known as Montero Lamar Hill, pleaded not guilty to four felony charges in Los Angeles, following his arrest last week. The 26-year-old faces three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting an executive officer. His arrest on August 21 occurred after he was reportedly seen nearly naked on a Los Angeles street, with video footage showing him singing and interacting with a person filming. Hill, who rose to fame with "Old Town Road," has not publicly commented on the charges. This legal development draws attention to the artist known for his unique musical style and public persona, as the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is forecast to remain over the central Atlantic Ocean for the next couple of days, with expectations of weakening beginning Monday night and becoming a post-tropical cyclone by Wednesday. The National Hurricane Center reported Fernand approximately 485 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, with sustained winds of 60 mph. Crucially, the storm poses no threat to land, offering relief to coastal areas. This marks Fernand as the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which previously reached Category 5 strength without making landfall. NOAA had predicted an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store issued a statement responding to widespread backlash concerning its new logo and rebranding. The company acknowledged that it "could've done a better job sharing who we are" after criticism that the new logo, which removed the "Uncle Herschel" character and "old country store" phrase, appeared "generic" and "soulless." Cracker Barrel reassured customers that Uncle Herschel will remain on menus and in stores, and that core values and traditional decor elements like rocking chairs and antiques will persist, despite the updated branding. Shares of Cracker Barrel fell 7% amid the controversy.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks Deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García Amid Legal Battle</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 16:58:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Kilmar Ábrego García, who was detained by ICE after a mandatory check-in. His attorneys argue the detainment and threats of deportation to Uganda are unconstitutional, designed to coerce a guilty plea for human smuggling charges, which Ábrego García vehemently denies. The judge expressed significant concerns about the government's intentions, particularly regarding sending him to a country where he has no connections, and ordered him to remain in a Virginia detention center until a hearing on Friday. This marks a temporary victory in a contentious legal battle, following his previous wrongful deportation to El Salvador.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to revoke federal approval for US Wind’s offshore wind farm project off Maryland’s coast, as indicated in a U.S. District Court filing. Department of Justice attorneys requested a stay on a lawsuit challenging the Interior Department’s previous approval, stating the agency would vacate the project’s construction and operations plan by September 12. This significant move impacts a project, owned by Apollo Global Management and Renexia SpA, that was approved by the Biden administration last year and designed to generate enough power for 718,000 homes. The action underscores the administration's shift away from promoting clean energy initiatives.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police reported "far fewer" incidents of serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival compared to previous years, with two stabbings causing no serious injuries, despite 423 arrests. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward credited live facial recognition (LFR), metal detectors, and stop-and-search for preventing serious harm. However, the Met's use of LFR remains controversial, drawing criticism from civil liberty groups who label it a "mass surveillance tool" and question its accuracy for women and people of color. This year's event highlights an ongoing tension between public safety measures and privacy concerns at large cultural celebrations.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's 400-page memoir, "Nobody's Girl," is set for posthumous publication in October, months after her death by suicide at 41.

          <p>South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace is facing criticism for falsely identifying a man as a campus shooter in a now-deleted social media post. The incident occurred after the University of South Carolina issued a "credible report" alert, later retracted, about a shooter near the library. Mace posted a picture of a man with an umbrella, labeling him the "alleged shooter," prompting backlash from figures like gun control activist Fred Guttenberg, who warned of the potential for harm. Mace, whose child attends the university, later backtracked, calling for enhanced school security while acknowledging the terrifying experience for students.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "tragic mishap" and promised an investigation, but media freedom groups accused the Israeli military of a pattern of targeting journalists.

          <p>Netflix's animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" achieved notable box office success with a two-day sing-along theatrical release, estimated to have grossed $16 million to $20 million domestically. Despite this, industry analysts suggest the success is a one-off and unlikely to fundamentally change Netflix's strategy of prioritizing its streaming platform. The company typically leverages theatrical releases as marketing events or for awards consideration, making bespoke deals with cinema operators rather than adopting traditional longer runs. This "eventizing" approach proved effective, helping "KPop Demon Hunters" become Netflix's second-most watched English-language film, underscoring the promotional value of cinema.</p>

However, the path beyond September remains murky, with less certainty for subsequent cuts in October or December. Experts like Jason Granet of BNY suggest a slower easing pace, citing ongoing inflation concerns and a resilient economy despite a slowing labor market. Morgan Stanley, among others, expresses skepticism about the urgency for cuts and cautions against over-reliance on easing for stock market gains, highlighting the potential for unintended consequences similar to last year's bond market reactions.

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order seeking to punish individuals for burning the American flag, asserting it "incites riots" and could lead to a year in prison. The directive aims for prosecutions under "content-neutral laws" for flag desecration that incites "imminent lawless action," and targets foreign nationals with visa revocations. However, this directly challenges a 36-year-old Supreme Court precedent, established in *Texas v. Johnson*, which affirmed flag burning as protected free speech under the First Amendment.
