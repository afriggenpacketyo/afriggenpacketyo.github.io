        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an order to rename the Department of Defense, arguing the new name is more appropriate for the current global climate. While a formal change requires congressional approval, the order permits the "Department of War" title in official correspondence and non-statutory documents. The move, which Trump teased for months, aims to restore a "warrior ethos," though its legality and cost remain uncertain. The department was originally named the Department of War in 1789 before being changed after World War II.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has affirmed he will not drop out of the mayoral race, despite reports that Trump advisors considered offering him an ambassadorship to Saudi Arabia.

His continued candidacy could impact the race against Democratic front-runner Zohran Mamdani and fellow independent Andrew Cuomo. Trump has expressed a desire for a consolidated opposition to challenge Mamdani.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, significantly below forecasts and raising the unemployment rate to 4.3%, its highest since October 2021. Economists attribute the slowdown to the Trump administration's tariffs and the rapid adoption of AI, increasing business uncertainty. The weak hiring numbers, with job growth at a 15-year low excluding the pandemic, have intensified concerns about potential stagflation. The report makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut later this month highly probable to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the 2026 Group of 20 summit will be held at his golf resort in Doral, Florida, reviving a plan from his first term. The White House stated the resort would host the event "at-cost" without profit, though the decision raises ethical concerns similar to those that derailed a 2020 G7 summit plan at the same location. The G20 is a major economic forum representing the world's largest economies. The administration indicated it will take a "back-to-basics" approach, potentially with a smaller guest list.</p>

This is expected to create life-threatening surf and rip currents. Direct impacts, including heavy rainfall and potential flooding, could begin affecting Hawaii as early as Monday, with the main threats forecast for Tuesday.</p>

          <p>NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre has criticized the league's use of social justice slogans like "End Racism" and "Choose Love" in end zones, calling it the "league of divisiveness." Speaking on a podcast, Favre argued that while racism is still a problem, the NFL's approach creates more division rather than unity. He suggested the league should focus more on how far the country has come. The NFL began displaying these messages in 2020 and has since adjusted them, with a spokesman citing recent national tragedies as inspiration for the current phrases.</p>

The author argues that recent actions, such as appointing inexperienced ideologues and cutting funding, undermine decades of bipartisan policy and allow adversaries to fill the information void with their own propaganda, ultimately harming U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>The recent disappointing jobs report, which showed rising unemployment and weak hiring, could lead to a positive outcome for homebuyers and homeowners: lower mortgage rates. Because the Federal Reserve often cuts interest rates to stimulate a flagging economy, the weak labor market data increases the likelihood of a significant rate cut at the upcoming September meeting. Lenders have already begun pricing in an anticipated cut, contributing to recent rate declines. The new data raises the possibility of an even larger cut, which would likely push mortgage and refinancing rates down further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Unexplained Resignation of Fed Governor Kugler Raises Questions Amid Pressure Campaign on Board</h2>

          <p>The abrupt resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler in August continues to fuel speculation, especially in light of a public pressure campaign against her former colleague, Governor Lisa Cook. Real estate records reviewed by CNBC show an apparent inconsistency regarding Kugler's primary residence, though she attributed it to a county clerical error. This comes as the Trump administration targets Fed officials over policy disagreements, with the president seeking to gain a majority of his own nominees on the board. Kugler's departure has already allowed Trump to nominate a successor, advancing his goal of influencing the central bank's interest rate decisions.</p>

          <p>In response to political attacks on their agency's credibility, employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are publicly affirming the reliability of the government's economic data. Following President Trump's firing of the BLS Commissioner after a previous jobs report, current staff issued a statement emphasizing that their work is guided by law and statistical practice, not partisan influence. They defended the common practice of revising monthly jobs numbers as more data becomes available, countering claims that such revisions are a "major mistake." The employees vowed to continue publishing accurate data regardless of political pressure or how inconvenient the results may be.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for breaching competition laws in the advertising technology sector. Regulators found that the tech giant unfairly favored its own online advertising exchange, AdX, over rivals, leading to higher costs and reduced revenues for competitors and publishers. Google has called the decision "wrong" and plans to appeal, while President Trump criticized the fine as "very unfair" to an American company. This is the third time the EU has fined Google for anticompetitive behavior, and regulators have warned that the company may need to sell parts of its ad tech business to resolve the conflict of interest.</p>

The project is part of a broader modernization effort to prepare the airport for the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics.

The anticipated report from HHS, an agency now led by a prominent vaccine skeptic, has raised concerns among investors and the medical community.

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly on Friday, dropping to 6.29% following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This marks the largest one-day drop in over a year and brings rates to their lowest point since October of the previous year. The decline could provide relief to potential homebuyers who have been sidelined by high borrowing costs and home prices. A lower rate can reduce monthly payments by a considerable amount, though analysts question whether this drop will be substantial enough to fully reinvigorate a housing market.

Newsmax, which plans to refile, had accused Fox News of monopolistic behavior and using intimidation tactics to suppress conservative media competitors.

          <p>Following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle in an attempt to reset his government. Instead of a simple replacement, Starmer opted for a major shake-up, appointing new home and foreign secretaries and creating a scenario where the top three offices of state below prime minister are all held by women. This move is seen as an effort to seize authority and re-energize his administration after a difficult first year marked by poor approval ratings. The prime minister is hoping this new team can deliver on his agenda.</p>

          <p>Tesla's newly released "Master Plan IV" suggests the company is pivoting its primary focus from electric vehicles to artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, and autonomous robotaxis. The document makes no mention of new car models, instead envisioning a future of "sustainable abundance" where Tesla robots perform mundane tasks. This shift aligns with CEO Elon Musk's long-stated belief that AI is the key to making Tesla a ten-trillion-dollar company. The move comes as Tesla's car sales have slumped amid growing competition, and it reflects a significant gamble on unproven technologies over its core, highly successful automotive business.</p>
