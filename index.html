          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. Vice President JD Vance met in New Delhi and expressed optimism about the progress in ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. Both leaders highlighted the potential for a mutually beneficial India-U.S. Bilateral Trade Agreement and discussed enhancing cooperation in energy, defense, and strategic technologies. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer noted the need for reciprocity in the trade relationship but welcomed India's constructive engagement. Modi and Trump had previously agreed to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, with the U.S. goods trade with India estimated at $129 billion in 2024.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 22:29:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar's recent decline has presented central banks worldwide with a complex challenge: whether to devalue their own currencies. A weaker dollar generally provides relief by easing debt burdens and lowering import costs, but it can also hurt export competitiveness and potentially trigger retaliatory measures from the U.S. While some central banks, like the ECB, have used the opportunity to cut rates, others are hesitant due to concerns about inflation, capital flight, and debt burdens. Avoiding a currency war is the preferred approach for now, as central banks carefully balance the risks and benefits of devaluation.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a significant decline after President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates. Trump's remarks, delivered via social media, blamed Powell for being too slow to respond to economic developments, exacerbating market turmoil already fueled by tariff concerns. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all fell sharply, while the dollar index hit its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices reached a new record high as investors sought safe-haven assets amid the economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>China's private sector demonstrated resilience in the first quarter of the year, with nearly 2 million new private companies registered, marking a 7.1% increase from the previous year. This growth is seen as a positive sign despite the challenges posed by the US-China trade war. Private businesses contribute to over half of China's exports and accounted for 56.8% of the total trade value in the first quarter. However, analysts note that private and small businesses are more vulnerable to U.S. tariffs compared to state-owned enterprises.</p>

The research aims to find new ways to reduce the high costs of feeding astronauts, which can reach up to £20,000 per day. The experiment involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats, with the goal of creating a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station within two years. The ultimate vision is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon to support long-term human presence in space.</p>
