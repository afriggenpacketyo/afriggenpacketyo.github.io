          <p>China initiated large-scale military exercises near Taiwan, issuing a stern warning against Taiwanese independence.  The drills, involving the army, navy, and rocket forces, are seen as a response to Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's recent remarks.  Beijing considers Taiwan its territory and has threatened to reclaim it by force if necessary, while Taiwan rejects these claims. The U.S. has pledged to strengthen military ties with regional allies to counter China's influence.</p>
