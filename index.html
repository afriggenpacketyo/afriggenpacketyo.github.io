          <h2>British Film Industry Anxious Over Potential Trump Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 00:01:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British film and television industry is expressing concerns over potential tariffs proposed by President Trump on films made in "foreign lands." The industry, still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes, fears devastation if these tariffs are implemented, potentially emptying studios and affecting workers' mental health and finances. Britain's generous tax breaks and experienced workforce have long attracted Hollywood productions, making the UK a critical hub for major film projects like 'Jurassic World Rebirth' and 'House of the Dragon.' The British government is actively discussing these potential tariffs with the U.S. administration to assess the situation. Optimism is tempered by the knowledge that even short-term tariffs could devastate the workforce.</p>

          <p>An ongoing Israeli military operation in the West Bank has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, leading to concerns that Israel may be preparing to annex the territory. The operation, targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, has resulted in the demolition of homes and roads, and the establishment of a long-term military presence in cities like Jenin and Tulkarm. Palestinians fear this extended presence undermines the Palestinian Authority and signals a move towards annexation, with some drawing parallels to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 war. While Israel claims the operations aim to restore security, Palestinians express fears of a second Nakba and the loss of their homes and future.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the renowned mystery novelist who passed away in 1976, has been digitally reanimated to teach an online writing course through BBC Maestro. Using a "digital prosthetic" created with artificial intelligence and archival material, Christie's likeness and voice are brought back to life, though the course script and content were written by academic researchers. While the project has the blessing of Christie's family, it raises ethical questions about the use of AI to resurrect the dead, particularly concerning consent and the potential for misrepresentation. Despite the concerns, proponents argue that the course offers a new way for fans to engage with Christie's work and learn about the craft of writing.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a second smartphone forensics expert, Jessica Hyde, testified that Jennifer McCabe's Google search about hypothermia occurred *after* John O'Keefe's body was discovered, contradicting the defense's claim that it happened *before*. Hyde's testimony supported the prosecution's timeline, asserting the defense's 2:27 a.m. timestamp was merely when McCabe opened a browser tab, not when she performed the search. The expert delved into technical details about data extraction and interpretation, highlighting how inexperienced analysts can misinterpret phone data. The defense argued that O'Keefe's phone was not properly secured, but the prosecution maintained its timeline of events based on recovered evidence.</p>
