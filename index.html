          <p>Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has announced that an illegal and forceful attempt to seize power is currently underway in the nation's capital. The declaration came after a faction of soldiers reportedly joined thousands of anti-government protesters demonstrating in the city. In a formal statement, the presidency condemned the move as a violation of the constitution and democratic principles. President Rajoelina has urged the international community to take notice of the volatile and developing situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed doubling tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a measure aimed at protecting its domestic industry from global overproduction. This move is seen by some as a protectionist strategy, similar to recent U.S. policies, drawing criticism from China. However, the EU frames it as a balanced approach that still allows for a significant volume of tariff-free imports. The policy is also interpreted as a strategic effort to pressure the U.S. into negotiating concessions on its own tariffs against European steel, though it risks damaging trade relations with other partners like the UK and India.

          <p>China's car dealerships are experiencing a severe financial crisis, with major participants reporting a 10% sales decline in the first half of 2025, following an 18% drop in 2024. The intense price war among manufacturers and competition from e-commerce platforms have left most dealers with huge losses and negative cash flow. Industry associations are sounding the alarm, with one forecasting that many of its members could face corporate failure within two years. There are now urgent calls for banks and financial institutions to provide support to stabilize the struggling auto distribution industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is phasing in its new digital border management tool, the Entry/Exit System (EES), across the 29-country Schengen Area. This system will replace manual passport stamping by digitally tracking the entry and exit of non-EU citizens. On their first use, travelers will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, which will be valid for three years. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, there are concerns about potential delays and queues as it is gradually rolled out at airports and border crossings like Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to lead the team to the World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the painful 3-1 playoff defeat against Ukraine that ended their hopes for the 2022 tournament. Having already successfully guided Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, Clarke is now focused on ending the nation's 28-year absence from the men's World Cup. A victory in the upcoming match against Belarus would significantly boost their qualification chances and could secure a play-off spot depending on other results.</p>

          <p>A year after being violently assaulted, Deutsche Welle reporter Adonis Alkhaled is still seeking justice as the police investigation into the incident continues with no resolution. Alkhaled was attacked at a concert in Düsseldorf by men he believes were bodyguards for Syrian hip-hop artist Al Shami, leaving him with facial injuries and a suspected concussion. Despite providing video footage and identifying a potential suspect, a professional boxer, Alkhaled feels the authorities have been too slow to act.

          <p>An agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein formalizing the right of Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays has sparked a media-driven debate. Despite some tabloid headlines claiming Muslims were receiving "extra holidays," the regulation merely clarifies a long-standing legal practice rooted in Germany's constitutional protection of religious freedom. The policy aligns with existing provisions for Christian and Jewish holidays, where members of those faiths can also take unpaid leave for religious observances. Officials and scholars have dismissed the controversy, stating the agreement creates no new legal entitlements but simply affirms equality.</p>

          <p>The Philippines has accused China of escalating tensions in the South China Sea after a Chinese Coast Guard ship allegedly rammed a Philippine government vessel and used water cannons against it. The incident occurred near Thitu Island, which is controlled by Manila, while the Philippine ship was anchored as part of a mission to protect local fishermen. The Philippine government described the act as a "clear threat" from Beijing.

          <p>A major trauma hospital in Portland was forced to reroute emergency air ambulances after an anarchist group called for a "laser party" aimed at disrupting federal aircraft near an ICE facility. The online flyer encouraged participants to shine laser pointers at helicopters, creating a significant safety risk for pilots. As a result, multiple air ambulance providers declined to land at the hospital's helipad, requiring critically ill patients to be transferred by ground and adding up to an hour of transit time. Law enforcement and homeland security officials have condemned the event, emphasizing that targeting an aircraft with a laser is a dangerous federal crime.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered how a single differentiated plant cell can regenerate into an entirely new plant by manipulating just two genetic switches. This process, known as somatic embryogenesis, allows a non-reproductive cell to revert to an embryonic state and develop into a complete organism. The breakthrough challenges the long-held belief that this regenerative ability was exclusive to fertilized egg cells. This finding, published in the journal Cell, could have significant implications for agriculture, plant cloning, and conservation efforts by providing a new method for plant propagation.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable performance, walk-on running back King Miller led the USC Trojans to a decisive 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan. Miller, a redshirt freshman who was deep on the depth chart, was called upon after USC's top two running backs left the game with injuries. He seized the opportunity, rushing for 148 yards and a touchdown, including two long breakaway runs that shifted the game's momentum. Miller's unexpected contribution powered a crucial win for USC, which had previously struggled against ranked opponents, and created an inspiring underdog story.</p>

          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers have secured their spot in the National League Championship Series after defeating the rival Chicago Cubs 3-1 in a winner-take-all Game 5 of their Division Series. The Brewers' offense was driven by key two-out home runs from William Contreras, Andrew Vaughn, and Brice Turang. This victory marks Milwaukee's first postseason series win since 2018 and was particularly significant as it came against the Cubs, now managed by former Brewers skipper Craig Counsell. The Brewers will now face the Los Angeles Dodgers for a chance to advance to the World Series.</p>

          <p>An Indiana jury has found Alison Davis not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, in 2023. Prosecutors had alleged that she beat him to death and staged the scene to look like he had accidentally fallen down the stairs, citing multiple skull fractures as evidence inconsistent with a simple fall. However, the defense successfully argued that Kevin's fatal injuries were caused by a single impact with a wooden banister post at the bottom of the steep staircase. The verdict came after a four-day trial that hinged on conflicting testimony from forensic medical experts, leading to Alison's release after 17 months of incarceration.</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Dodgers prepare to face the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series, this article analyzes the key threats posed by their opponent. The Brewers have built a successful team on a modest payroll by focusing on a disciplined, small-ball offensive approach that emphasizes getting on base and manufacturing runs. Their primary strength, however, lies in a deep and formidable pitching staff, led by ace Freddy Peralta and supported by a versatile bullpen that proved effective against the Dodgers during the regular season. Milwaukee's unique brand of baseball presents a significant strategic challenge to the Dodgers' World Series aspirations.</p>

          <p>Austin Beutner, the former superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, is planning to challenge Mayor Karen Bass in the 2026 election. Beutner is launching his campaign with sharp criticism of the current administration's handling of major city issues, including crime, housing affordability, and the response to the devastating Palisades fire. As the first prominent challenger to enter the race, Beutner, a former investment banker and philanthropist, could pose a serious threat to Bass's bid for a second term. His entry may also encourage other high-profile candidates to consider running for the city's top office.</p>

          <p>Amid an ongoing federal government shutdown, Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to use all available funds to ensure military personnel receive their pay on schedule. The move comes as hundreds of thousands of other government workers have been furloughed or are working without compensation. The administration has also initiated layoffs of some federal employees, a step intended to increase pressure on Democrats to approve a spending plan. The shutdown stems from a political impasse over funding for healthcare programs and tax credits, with both parties blaming each other for the failure to reach an agreement.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has released a new television series titled "Silent Honour," which marks a rare official tribute to the Communist Party's espionage activities in Taiwan following the Chinese Civil War. The drama chronicles the stories of covert agents sent to the island starting in 1949, many of whom were ultimately captured and executed by the Kuomintang government. The series represents a significant shift in Beijing's willingness to publicly acknowledge and commemorate these clandestine operations, which have historically been a sensitive and seldom-discussed topic in mainland China.</p>
