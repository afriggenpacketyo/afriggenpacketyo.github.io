          <p>Russia is reviving its Soviet-era "Intervision" song contest, positioning it as a conservative counter to the Western-oriented Eurovision Song Contest, from which Russian artists have been banned since 2022. President Vladimir Putin's initiative aims to promote "national identity" and "traditional values," with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov explicitly rejecting "perversions and mockery of human nature." The event near Moscow features 23 countries, including former Soviet republics and BRICS partners like Brazil, China, and India, with a substantial cash prize.</p>

          <p>An 80-year-old British man, Peter Reynolds, and his 76-year-old wife, Barbie, have been released by the Taliban after nearly eight months of detention in Afghanistan and are now returning to the UK. Their son expressed immense gratitude for their release, which followed Qatar-brokered negotiations. The Taliban claimed the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the reason for their arrest. Despite their ordeal, the couple, who lived in Afghanistan for 18 years running a charity, expressed a desire to return to continue their humanitarian work.</p>

          <p>Estonia has called for urgent consultations with NATO members after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets reportedly violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes. This incident, the fifth Russian violation this year, prompted jets from Italy, Finland, and Sweden to intercept the aircraft. Russia denied the violation, claiming its jets flew over neutral waters. This development follows similar airspace breaches reported by Poland and Romania, intensifying concerns about escalating tensions on NATO's eastern flank amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

Despite France's head coaches acknowledging England's statistical dominance and a 16-match losing streak against them, the French team remains defiant, emphasizing that past statistics do not dictate a World Cup semi-final outcome. France, however, faces significant challenges with key players suspended or injured, making their path to a first World Cup final appearance a daunting one.</p>

          <p>Many individuals who have achieved significant weight loss using injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are now grappling with the psychological and physical impact of loose skin. While celebrating health improvements, some, like Emilly Murray, feel self-conscious, comparing their post-weight loss bodies to "90-year-old women." Experts explain that rapid weight loss often leaves stretched skin, which can cause irritation or, more commonly, dent self-confidence. Surgical body contouring is the only effective solution for significant loose skin, but these procedures are rarely covered by the NHS and can be prohibitively expensive privately.</p>

          <p>Four individuals, including three teenagers, have been arrested in connection with an alleged hate crime assault on a 39-year-old transgender woman in Renton, Washington. The victim reported being chased, knocked to the ground, and repeatedly assaulted by the group, who also made homophobic and transphobic remarks. She suffered multiple broken bones and lost consciousness during the attack, believing she was going to die. Video evidence and witness accounts corroborated the assault. Two juvenile suspects have pleaded not guilty to second-degree assault and hate crime charges, while the other two, including a 25-year-old man, await charging decisions.</p>

          <p>Qingzhou Wang, a 37-year-old principal executive of China-based Amarvel Biotech, has been sentenced to 25 years in a US prison for trafficking chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Wang and his marketing manager, Yiyi Chen (sentenced to 15 years), were convicted of fentanyl precursor importation and money laundering. The Justice Department stated the company operated as a "pipeline of poison," disguising hundreds of kilos of precursors as everyday goods and profiting through cryptocurrency. This case marks a significant step in US efforts to target Chinese companies directly involved in the fentanyl supply chain.</p>
