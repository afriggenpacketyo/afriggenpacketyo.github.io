        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As gold prices surge due to market volatility and economic uncertainty, investors are increasingly turning to the gold-silver ratio to inform their strategies. The gold-silver ratio measures how many ounces of silver are needed to purchase one ounce of gold, providing insights into the relative value of each metal. Currently, with gold around $3,200 per ounce and silver at $32, the ratio is high, suggesting silver may be undervalued. While silver is more cost-effective, it's also more volatile than gold, which is often favored for portfolio diversification. Investors use the ratio as a guide to decide whether to buy or sell gold versus silver, though opinions vary on whether the ratio will return to its historical average.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center. The charges stem from an incident on May 9 when McIver and other Democratic lawmakers visited the facility. Separately, the DOJ dropped a misdemeanor trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka, who was arrested during the same event after being denied entry to the detention center. McIver maintains that ICE agents instigated the confrontation, while Republicans have accused the lawmakers of "storming" the facility. Alina Habba, the interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, stated that the decision to drop the charge against Baraka was made "for the sake of moving forward."</p>

          <p>An inquest concluded that the death of 11-year-old Kyra Hill, who drowned at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire, was an unlawful killing due to gross breaches in health and safety. Kyra got into difficulty in a designated swimming area in August 2022, and was found over an hour after emergency services were alerted. The inquest highlighted the lack of an emergency plan, risk assessment, and adequate warning signs regarding water depth, which reached over 15 feet in some areas. Senior coroner Heidi Connor stated that the absence of these safety measures and the poor water visibility contributed to Kyra's death, with the park owner previously fined Â£80,000 in June 2024.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker was arrested and accused of aiding ten inmates in their escape from a New Orleans jail. The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office reported that the inmates forced open a cell door and breached a wall behind the toilet to escape. They were later seen fleeing the building through a loading dock and climbing over a fence to escape into a neighborhood. The escape went unnoticed for several hours due to the absence of a deputy in the area and a civilian monitor being away. As of Monday, four of the ten escapees have been captured, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

Despite exhaustion from ongoing Russian bombardments, Ukrainians express a determination to continue fighting for their future. President Zelensky has sent a letter to Trump proposing a free-trade agreement to maintain a relationship with Washington.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior homeowners seeking to tap into their home equity have two primary options: a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a reverse mortgage. HELOCs offer a flexible credit line with lower interest rates than credit cards or personal loans, suitable for short-term needs like home improvements or debt consolidation. Reverse mortgages, available to homeowners 62 and older, allow seniors to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited income. While HELOCs require repayment, reverse mortgages are repaid when the homeowner dies, moves, or sells the home, but they accrue interest and fees over time. Experts recommend considering individual financial situations and consulting professionals to determine the best option.</p>

The statement signals a growing rift between Israel and its traditional Western allies. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu responded sharply, accusing the three countries of encouraging further attacks. The international criticism centers on the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, exacerbated by a two-month Israeli blockade.

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a decision to allow asset managers to offer an ETF share class of existing mutual funds, potentially giving investors more choices. Over 50 asset managers have sought exemptive relief for this structure, currently offered by Vanguard under specific rules. The SEC's Mark Uyeda indicated the agency is prioritizing the issue, with firms like Dimensional Fund Advisors submitting amendments based on SEC feedback. Key differences between ETFs and mutual funds include intraday trading and tax treatment, with concerns that co-mingling funds could lead to unexpected tax bills for ETF holders. Dimensional's amendment includes guidelines to address tax impacts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill to rally House Republicans to support his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which narrowly passed a House committee vote on Sunday. The president is expected to turn up the pressure on members to fall in line as the party's dueling factions have threatened to upend the plan as they set down apparent red lines that don't align with the demands made from other members. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee. The White House said the president will make an announcement with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office at 3 p.m. EST.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for his budget package, facing resistance from both conservative and moderate factions. Conservatives seek deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates oppose changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a challenge in securing enough votes, as Democrats are expected to oppose the bill. Trump urged Republicans to support his "one big, beautiful bill," suggesting consequences for those who don't. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

DW Fact Check debunked claims that Biden has "stage five" metastatic cancer, clarifying that there is no such classification. The diagnosis was characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5), indicating a very aggressive cancer. The article also addresses claims that Biden's health diagnosis was covered up, noting that the White House has previously been transparent about his health.

          <p>In her new book, Joan C. Williams argues that the Democratic party misunderstands working-class voters and needs to refocus on their concerns. Williams suggests that the left shifted its focus from economic stability for blue-collar workers to issues more relevant to college-educated elites. She emphasizes the importance of pre-distribution policies, such as fair wages and job guarantees, over redistribution. Williams criticizes the Democratic party's style as catering to college graduates and advocates for cultural competence to bridge the class divide. She argues that Trump's policies have created an opportunity for the left to win back working-class voters by addressing their economic anxieties.</p>

This includes roughly 25% of customers trading in a Tesla for a Cadillac Lyriq SUV this year, up from 10% to 15% previously. Cadillac attributes this increase to its full EV lineup and Tesla's declining sales amid CEO Elon Musk's support of President Donald Trump and his actions as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Empire Wind 1 will be the first offshore wind project to deliver electricity directly to New York City. New York Gov.

Equinor said it aims to execute planned installation activities this year and minimize the impact of the stop-work order in order to reach its goal of starting commercial operations in 2027.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's resumption of collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans has far-reaching consequences for delinquent borrowers. Borrowers who are in default may have wages, tax returns and Social Security payments garnished. But involuntary collections could also have a "spillover effect," which puts consumers at risk of falling behind on other debt repayments, according to a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Monthly collections on defaulted loans may reduce disposable personal income between $3.1 billion to $8.5 billion a month, according to research by JPMorgan. After the five-year pause ended and collections are resumed, the delinquency rate for student loan balances spiked, the New York Fed found.</p>
