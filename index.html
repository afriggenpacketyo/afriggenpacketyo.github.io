        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts advise exploring credit card debt forgiveness this June due to high and persistent interest rates, the lengthy process involved, and its relatively less damaging effect on credit compared to default or bankruptcy.  Credit card interest rates are unlikely to drop significantly soon, making forgiveness a potentially worthwhile strategy. The process can take 24-48 months, so starting early is crucial.  Debt forgiveness demonstrates a commitment to repayment to future creditors.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space but lost control due to a propellant leak. The spacecraft broke up during re-entry.  While the company made progress in addressing previous ascent issues, the propellant leak prevented data collection from planned tests.  Elon Musk stated that future test flights will be conducted more frequently.  The article discusses the challenges SpaceX faces in making Starship reusable.</p>

          <p>A federal judge granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to a sensitive Treasury Department system controlling federal payments.  The ruling follows a legal battle over DOGE's access request.  The judge concluded that the Trump administration established adequate training and security measures to prevent improper disclosures.  The decision allows DOGE to expand its access to the system.</p>
