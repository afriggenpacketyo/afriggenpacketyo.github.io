        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actor Steve Buscemi has revealed that most people, including himself for many years, have been mispronouncing his last name. During a recent interview, he explained that while the traditional Italian way is 'Boo-shemi,' he grew up saying 'Bue-semi' and has now settled on 'Boo-Semi' as a compromise. The discussion arose from a running joke in his cameo on the series "The Studio," where characters debated the correct pronunciation. This follows a similar revelation from actor Denzel Washington, who also recently shared that his name has been commonly mispronounced throughout his career.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Russia, China, and North Korea recently convened in Beijing, signaling a strengthening alliance among nations considered adversaries of the United States. Analysts discussed the event as a clear declaration of their intent to challenge the post-war international order established and led by the U.S. The article notes commentary suggesting the Trump administration's foreign policy, characterized by conflicts with allies and accommodation of enemies, may inadvertently support this goal. The gathering highlights a significant geopolitical shift as these powers align more closely to counter Western influence and reshape global dynamics.</p>

          <p>In one of the largest single-site immigration enforcement operations in U.S. history, federal authorities detained 475 workers at a Hyundai facility in Georgia. The raid, part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices, primarily involved South Korean nationals who allegedly entered the U.S. illegally or violated the terms of their visas. The operation, involving multiple agencies including ICE and the FBI, has been framed by officials as a measure to protect American jobs. However, it has drawn criticism from labor advocates for creating a climate of fear among immigrant communities and disrupting a major economic project.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has adjusted his prominent pledge to stop small boat migrant crossings within two weeks of gaining power. He clarified that this timeline would only begin after his proposed 'Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill' is passed into law, a process that could take months. This new legislation would grant the home secretary the power to detain and deport migrants who arrive illegally, while also disapplying international treaties like the Refugee Convention. The clarification follows scrutiny over the feasibility of his original, more aggressive timeline, which was a central promise of his party's platform.</p>

          <p>Scotland's momentum in the Women's Rugby World Cup was halted by a defeat against world number two, Canada, in a competitive match in Exeter. Despite an early try from Rhona Lloyd and a second-half score by Evie Gallagher, the Scots were overpowered by a dominant Canadian side. The loss means Scotland will now likely face host nation England, the winner of Pool A, in the quarter-finals.

          <p>This opinion article critiques Melania Trump's recent focus on artificial intelligence, particularly her call to treat AI's development like raising a child with "watchful guidance." The author argues that while the first lady positions herself as a champion of responsible innovation, her advocacy is undermined by the Trump administration's broader policies, such as defunding public education programs like Head Start and promoting censorship. The article suggests that the administration's embrace of AI is more likely to enrich tech executives allied with Trump than to foster equitable educational progress. It also touches on other topics, including a venture capitalist's treatment of a surrogate and efforts by Epstein victims to compile a client list.</p>

She also addressed criticism regarding the 2022 decision to overturn Roe v.

The dive, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique ecosystem and the challenges it faces from pollution and tourism. Experts provided commentary on the lake's ancient geological history, explaining its ecological importance as the ROV traversed the lakebed over 1,500 feet below the surface. The event highlighted ongoing efforts to preserve the lake's famed clarity and debunked popular myths about mob bodies, though no sign of the mythical creature 'Tessie' was found.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investment firm, has taken a significant stake in PepsiCo and is pushing for substantial changes to improve the company's performance. In a detailed presentation to the board, Elliott outlined a plan that includes refranchising the bottling network for the PepsiCo Beverages North America segment to improve margins. The firm also recommends divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, reducing the number of products to streamline operations, and reinvesting capital into core brands such as Frito-Lay and Gatorade. Elliott argues these strategic shifts could unlock at least 50% upside for shareholders by addressing years of stock underperformance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial coach Bernadette Joy, a self-made millionaire who previously owned four properties, explains why she and her husband sold their homes to become renters. She argues that renting has made her wealthier by allowing her to invest the proceeds and focus on her business without the stress and hidden costs of homeownership, such as renovations and unexpected repairs. Joy also found being a landlord to be emotionally and financially draining for the returns it provided. While acknowledging the long-term benefits of buying, she values the flexibility of renting, which allows her to adapt her living space to her needs without being tied down by a mortgage.</p>

In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document jazz musicians and their audiences, but it was abandoned due to FBI suspicion of her leftist politics. The photos capture not just the rapture of the audience but also the wariness and inner life of the musicians, including Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. The article suggests Model, who fled the Nazis, may have felt a shared experience of persecution with her Black subjects, who faced racism and violence in the U.S. despite their international acclaim.</p>

Described as an empathetic and understated leader, he is expected to work collaboratively with the football operations staff rather than ruling with an iron fist.

These types of fires tend to occur in remote areas, allowing them to grow larger and produce more smoke, which worsens air quality and public health crises. The research predicts that 98% of the western U.S. will face a heightened risk due to either more frequent lightning, drier fire-prone weather, or a combination of both. This trend could strain already limited firefighting resources and exacerbate public safety challenges, from smoke-related deaths to flash floods in burn scars.</p>

Key changes include Shabana Mahmood becoming the new Home Secretary, tasked with tackling the small boats crisis, and Yvette Cooper moving to Foreign Secretary.

          <p>Recent political discourse in Germany has focused on several key issues, including a reported crisis in the mental health of students, with calls for a €100 billion investment in schools. In foreign policy, Bavarian leader Markus Söder has questioned the idea of stationing NATO troops in Ukraine, arguing it would be a step toward NATO membership that Russia would never accept. Domestically, senior figures in the CDU/CSU party are advocating for the coalition government to shift further to the center-right, particularly by implementing significant cuts to social welfare programs, a move opposed by their SPD coalition partners.</p>

          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and television host Matt Tebbutt will replace Gregg Wallace as a judge on the upcoming series of 'MasterChef: The Professionals.' Tebbutt, known for hosting 'Saturday Kitchen,' will join fellow judges Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti. The change comes after Wallace was dismissed in July following an independent inquiry that upheld 45 allegations of misconduct, including inappropriate comments and unwelcome physical contact. Wallace apologized for any distress caused but stated he never intended to harm or humiliate anyone. The BBC has yet to announce replacements for the main amateur series of the show.</p>

          <p>China is designing a mission to test its ability to defend Earth from potential asteroid impacts, according to the chief designer of its lunar exploration program. The plan involves launching an impactor spacecraft to collide with a small asteroid tens of millions of kilometers away, with the goal of altering its orbit by 3 to 5 centimeters. An observer spacecraft would accompany the mission to monitor the kinetic impact and gather data. If successful, China would become only the second country, after the United States, to demonstrate this planetary defense capability, marking a significant step in its deep space exploration ambitions.</p>

          <p>In a remote area of Sudan's Darfur region, villagers are using their bare hands to search for victims of a devastating landslide triggered by heavy rainfall. Aid group Save the Children reports scenes of 'destruction and devastation,' with estimates of the death toll varying widely but potentially reaching as high as 1,000 people, including 200 children. Rescue and relief efforts are severely hampered by the area's remoteness and the ongoing civil war in Sudan, which makes it difficult for aid workers and machinery to reach the affected villages. Aid workers had to travel by donkey to deliver the first batch of humanitarian supplies.</p>

          <p>The family of Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old American-Turkish woman killed by an Israeli sniper in the occupied West Bank, is still seeking accountability one year after her death. Eygi was shot while attending a protest against settlement expansion near Nablus. An Israeli military investigation quickly concluded the shooting was unintentional, but her family and a Washington Post investigation dispute this. Despite repeated requests from the family, the U.S. government has not launched its own investigation, a response the family describes as a double standard compared to cases of other Americans killed abroad, leaving them feeling disillusioned and determined to continue their fight for justice.</p>

          <p>A recent National Conservatism conference in Washington D.C. featured a speaker list that included senior Republican figures and Trump administration officials alongside theocratic Christian nationalists and far-right publishers. The event raises questions about the distinction between the mainstream Republican party and more extreme nationalist movements. Speakers included a senator, a deputy attorney general, and individuals associated with secretive, men-only ultranationalist groups. Analysts note that the presence of administration officials at such an event demonstrates how difficult it has become to separate the far-right from the current administration's ideology and personnel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices reaching new records, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure to gold through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the physical price of bullion, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). This method is considered more liquid, tax-efficient, and low-cost compared to owning physical gold bars or coins, which involve higher transaction and storage costs. Despite the current rally, advisors typically suggest limiting gold to a small portion, under 3%, of a well-diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

However, his life also had deeply mystical elements; he limited his gaming to one hour a week and used his computer skills to create a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles. His story appeals to different corners of the faith, representing both a modern, relatable figure and a deeply devout, countercultural believer.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway premiere, the cultural and political legacy of the musical "Hamilton" is being reassessed as a filmed version hits movie theaters for the first time. The article explores how the show, once seen as a symbol of the hopeful, progressive Obama era, feels different in the current political climate. Initially celebrated for its diverse casting and hip-hop storytelling, "Hamilton" later faced criticism for its portrayal of the Founding Fathers and its perceived glossing over of issues like slavery. The show's journey from an elite phenomenon to a cultural touchstone reflects the shifting political and social conversations in America over the past decade.</p>

          <p>A jury in Ventura County has convicted a couple, Margarita Jimenez and Jorge Garfias, of the first-degree murder of Garfias's ex-girlfriend, Yanelly Vargas. Prosecutors said the pair lured Vargas out of a bar in 2024, beat her in an alley, and then pursued her in a truck as she tried to flee. Surveillance footage showed Jimenez shooting Vargas in the chest. A trail of evidence, including a blood-stained rope, a spent shell casing, and broken acrylic nails matched to Jimenez, helped investigators crack the case. The motive was believed to be jealousy on the part of Jimenez.</p>

Following an earlier NPR article, the Zambian government intervened, partnering with local community leaders like Pastor Billiance Chondwe to connect thousands of patients with government-run clinics for free medication. While this has been a crucial success, patients now face new challenges, as the closed U.S.-funded clinics also provided essential food support.

The statement comes after U.S. officials reported Venezuelan aircraft flew close to a U.S. vessel in the Caribbean for the second time in two days. This escalation follows a recent U.S. strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel from Venezuela. The Trump administration has intensified its anti-drug-trafficking operations in the region, deploying additional naval assets, while Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the U.S. of seeking regime change through military threats.</p>

The unfounded rumors, which trended on Google and X, highlight a media culture fueled by conspiracy theories, partisan wishful thinking, and the constant demand for content from an omnipresent president. The article suggests that because Trump has created an expectation of near-constant public communication, his brief absence created an information vacuum that was quickly filled with misinformation. The episode serves as an insight into the current political and media landscape, where the line between scrutiny and baseless speculation is increasingly blurred.</p>
