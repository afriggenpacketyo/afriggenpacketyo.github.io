Hochman emphasized that while peaceful protests are tolerated, violent acts will be prosecuted, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between legitimate demonstrations and criminal behavior.

For example, many people in England and Wales will be paying higher council tax to help fund the police - something not set out explicitly by Rachel Reeves at the dispatch box. The analysis underscores the importance of patience and careful examination in understanding the full scope and consequences of government spending decisions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration can no longer detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, based on claims that he is a threat to US foreign policy. Judge Michael E Farbiarz stated that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged, and his speech was being chilled. Khalil, who has not been charged with a crime, has been held in a detention facility in Louisiana since March. Farbiarz noted that Khalil can still remain in custody on the basis of officials' claims that he inaccurately filled out his green card application.</p>
