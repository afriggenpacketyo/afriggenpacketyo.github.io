          <p>Actress Halle Berry celebrated her 59th birthday with a tropical vacation, sharing photos of herself enjoying the getaway. In one post, she was seen in red lingerie swimming with an inflatable duck, which she captioned, "Making the most of a cloudy day." The vacation posts were also seen as a subtle response to recent comments made by her ex-husband, David Justice, about their past marriage, with Berry captioning another photo with a reference to escaping from "cooking, cleaning and mothering."</p>

          <p>An upcoming meeting in Washington involving Ukrainian President Zelensky, U.S. President Trump, and European leaders is being viewed as potentially more critical for Ukraine's future than the recent Trump-Putin summit. European leaders are determined to convey a united front, emphasizing that any peace deal must directly involve Ukraine and be supported by robust, 'cast-iron' security guarantees. The diplomatic effort aims to ensure the U.S. does not concede to Russian demands following the Alaska talks, which produced no major breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accompanied by several European leaders including the NATO Secretary General and UK Prime Minister, is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington. This high-stakes meeting follows a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that did not result in a ceasefire. The gathering of allies is seen as an effort to present a united front and ensure Ukraine's interests are central to any discussions about a potential peace deal and security arrangements.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This development is being described as a potential "game-changing" concession, as it could provide Ukraine with a strong defense guarantee without formal NATO membership, a long-standing objection from Moscow. Details on how such an agreement would be implemented have not yet been released.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel participated in a nationwide strike, blocking major roads and closing businesses to pressure the government into securing a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of hostages from Gaza. The demonstrations, organized by hostage families, reflect growing public frustration with the prolonged war and fears that a planned military offensive could further endanger the approximately 50 hostages still held. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the protests, stating they would only harden Hamas's position.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, was downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly intensifying to a powerful Category 5. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate that the storm will likely strengthen again and remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of the week. While not projected to make a direct U.S. landfall, Erin is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast and prompting warnings in the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.</p>

By cutting back in these areas, Kamel suggests that people can free up significant funds to allocate toward more important financial goals, such as building an emergency fund or paying down debt.

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has announced that its members deployed in Washington, D.C. as part of a federal anti-crime initiative may now be armed, revising a previous policy. The deployment is a component of the Trump administration's plan to increase law enforcement presence in the capital, a move that has drawn significant criticism from local officials as an act of federal overreach. The Guard's role is described as a "visible crime deterrent," and they are not expected to conduct arrests.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that while Americans' balances in traditional checking and savings accounts have stagnated, their total cash reserves are growing due to a shift toward higher-yield financial products. Savers are increasingly moving funds into money market funds, brokerage accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs) to achieve better returns in the current economic climate. This trend is particularly notable among lower-income households and may help explain the continued strength of consumer spending despite inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An early goalkeeping error by Altay Bayindir was the decisive moment in Manchester United's 1-0 opening-day loss to Arsenal. United's manager, Ruben Amorim, chose Bayindir over the recently recovered Andre Onana, a decision that came under scrutiny after Bayindir failed to properly handle a corner kick, leading directly to Arsenal's goal. Despite Amorim's post-match defense of his keeper, the mistake has intensified the ongoing debate surrounding Manchester United's goalkeeping situation for the new season.</p>
