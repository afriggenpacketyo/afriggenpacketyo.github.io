          <p>A judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enroll foreign students, following a lawsuit filed by Harvard alleging the move was a blatant violation of the law and free speech rights. The Trump administration claimed Harvard hadn't done enough to combat antisemitism, which Harvard denied. The order pauses the Department of Homeland Security's move to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, a database managing foreign students, with a hearing set for May 29 in Boston. The article underscores the uncertainty faced by international students and the potential financial impact on Harvard if foreign enrollment were restricted.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel would remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. Trump claimed the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Nippon Steel's bid to buy U.S. Steel had previously been blocked by former President Biden, but under Trump, it was subject to another national security review. Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% following the announcement, although details of the deal and ownership structure remained unclear.</p>

          <p>National Transportation Safety Board officials confirmed that a small plane crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego after hitting high-tension power lines while approaching the airport for landing. The crash killed all six people on board and incinerated nearby homes and cars. The pilot did not report any problems, and the airport's weather system was inoperative due to an unrelated power surge. NTSB investigators are examining pilot qualifications, training, flight history, and environmental factors, with wreckage recovery underway.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration formally accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students, escalating its crackdown on colleges. This action follows months of targeting Columbia, including the suspension of over $400 million in research funding. The administration alleges Columbia breached Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by recipients of federal funds. The move formalizes previous accusations against Columbia regarding its response to antisemitic episodes on campus and its handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a budget package that includes historic spending cuts to Medicaid and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), formerly known as food stamps. The legislation, called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," proposes slashing Medicaid spending by roughly $700 billion and SNAP by about $300 billion, the largest cuts in the programs' histories. These cuts are intended to help pay for tax perks, primarily for the wealthy, included in the bill. Critics argue that many people will lose benefits, including those entitled to them, as a result of these changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders focused on accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants in the United States, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months, while another encourages the Energy and Defense departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. The administration also set a goal of quadrupling the nationâ€™s fleet of nuclear power plants by 2050. These actions aim to address a declared "national energy emergency" and reflect bipartisan support for nuclear power as a clean energy source.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly attempting to dismiss criminal charges against a top MS-13 leader, Vladimir Antonio Arevalo-Chavez, to deport him to El Salvador. Arevalo-Chavez has knowledge of a secretive pact between the Salvadoran government and the gang, raising concerns that his deportation aims to prevent him from testifying about President Bukele's past ties to MS-13. Critics argue that the move is a favor to Bukele, who struck a deal with the gang in 2019, and part of a larger agreement to incarcerate immigrants in Salvadoran prisons. The justice department has cited "sensitive and important foreign policy considerations" as the reason for dismissing the charges.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court temporarily shielded the Trump administration from a lower court order requiring Elon Muskâ€™s government efficiency team (DOGE) to turn over internal documents requested under open records laws. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued a temporary stay to allow the full court to consider the administration's emergency application arguing that Musk's group should be exempt from public records laws. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), seeking information about Muskâ€™s team.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. Treatment typically involves a surgery called ventricular shunting, which bypasses the blocked channel and lets fluid drain. The prognosis depends on when the disease is diagnosed, with early diagnosis leading to better outcomes.</p>

Trump's orders force the NRC to make decisions on nuclear license applications within 18 months and create a regulatory framework for building nuclear reactors on federal land. The actions also aim to boost uranium mining in the U.S. and expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at overhauling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and accelerating the deployment of new nuclear power reactors in the U.S. The orders call for a "total and complete reform" of the NRC, requiring decisions on nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months. The administration also aims to boost uranium mining and expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity. The changes are intended to streamline regulations and promote the development of small, advanced reactors, while also supporting larger nuclear plants.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump cleared the merger of U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing a previous decision to block the deal on national security grounds. Trump stated that the partnership would create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. Shares of U.S. Steel surged following the announcement. President Joe Biden previously blocked the acquisition, citing concerns over supply chain security.</p>
