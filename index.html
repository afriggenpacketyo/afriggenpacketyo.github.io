          <h2>Harvard University Files Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over Funding Freeze</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 04:37:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration to challenge the proposed funding freeze, which threatens billions of dollars allocated for critical research initiatives. The lawsuit is a response to escalating tensions between the university and the administration, particularly following Harvard's rejection of demands related to diversity initiatives and anti-semitism measures. Harvard's president, Alan M. Garber, argues that the funding freeze will severely impact essential studies, including those focused on pediatric cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The White House has defended its stance, asserting that taxpayer funds are a privilege that Harvard has failed to meet the basic conditions to access.</p>

          <p>China's economy is showing signs of improvement, driven by the government's stimulus package implemented in September 2024, with first-quarter GDP growth reaching 5.4%. Policymakers have recognized falling demand, particularly in the real estate market, as a significant issue affecting local government revenues and consumer spending. Measures to alleviate pressure on local governments include allowing them to expand debt financing through long-term bonds. The central bank is maintaining faster credit growth but is cautious about lowering policy rates due to concerns about exchange-rate volatility and commercial banks' financial condition.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated a potential willingness to engage in direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marking a shift since the early stages of the war. The discussions could focus on preventing strikes on civilian targets, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Zelensky has responded by calling for a clear commitment from Moscow to cease attacks on civilian infrastructure, suggesting a 30-day truce involving no long-range drone or missile strikes. Putin acknowledged a recent strike on a civilian building in Sumy, while Ukraine reported Russian drone strikes in Odessa.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that Russia is leveraging Libya's infrastructure for human trafficking and smuggling to serve its own interests and those of domestic enterprises. With uncertainty surrounding its naval base in Syria, Russia has shifted its focus to Libya, supporting warlord Khalifa Haftar and utilizing mercenary groups like the former Wagner Group. Russia is reportedly interested in establishing a military presence in the Mediterranean, commercializing natural resources, and finding export markets for its weapons. The report alleges that Haftar's son, Saddam, is expanding Libya's role in smuggling weapons, drugs, fuel, and people, with the Kremlin potentially using migration as a weapon against Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced a dip below 140 yen, a level not seen since last September, following President Donald Trump's intensified criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. The yen gained strength due to speculation that the U.S. administration might urge Japan to address the yen's weakness during upcoming finance minister meetings. Trump's social media posts called for preemptive interest rate cuts to support the economy, raising concerns about the central bank's independence. Tokyo stocks showed mixed performance, with semiconductor-related issues declining and domestic demand-sensitive stocks attracting buying interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince William's decision to appoint Jason Knauf, who accused Meghan Markle of bullying, as CEO of The Earthshot Prize has fueled speculation of a deeper rift with Prince Harry and Meghan. Experts suggest this move sends a clear message, indicating William's disregard for his brother's feelings and solidifying Knauf's position as a trusted advisor. Knauf's previous role involved protecting Meghan from tabloids, but he later accused her of bullying palace staff, leading to resignations and further strained relationships. This appointment is seen as a sign of William valuing trustworthy individuals amidst perceived betrayals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores alternative systems for the NFL draft, aiming to balance league parity with player agency and reduce the reward for struggling franchises. Proposals include flipping the draft order, implementing a draft lottery, waiving the eligibility rule, and using a salary pool system. Flipping the draft order would prioritize teams closer to the playoffs, while a lottery would give all non-playoff teams a chance at top picks. Waiving the eligibility rule would allow players to be drafted earlier but potentially stashed until eligible to play, and a salary pool would let teams negotiate contracts with prospects, giving players more control over their destination.</p>

          <p>The United States State Department has reportedly advised allied countries to avoid using Chinese satellite services, citing concerns that these services could be used by Beijing to gather military information and sensitive intelligence. The memo advises governments to exclude untrusted satellite providers, particularly those based in China, to safeguard national security, business secrets, and citizens' privacy. Working with Chinese space providers in low Earth orbit could advance Beijing's foreign policy goals and risk transferring sensitive information to the Chinese government. The memo also warns of potential monopolistic control by Beijing in the satellite market.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has announced tariffs of up to 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, following an investigation into alleged subsidies from China and the dumping of unfairly cheap products. The tariffs vary by company and country, with some Cambodian exporters facing the highest duties due to a perceived lack of cooperation. The decision comes after major solar equipment producers requested protection for their U.S. operations. The International Trade Commission is expected to make a final decision on the tariffs in June.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to publish the nationalities of foreign criminals for the first time, along with details of their crimes. The move aims to provide the public with more information about foreign offenders awaiting deportation, which has increased since the Conservatives left office. Home Office sources attribute the rise to factors like early releases due to prison overcrowding and difficulties in deporting individuals to unstable countries. The most common nationalities among foreign criminals are expected to be Albanian, Romanian, and Polish, with common offenses including drug production, theft, and violent assault.</p>

The move contrasts with policies in other states and Washington, D.C., that issue licenses regardless of legal status.
