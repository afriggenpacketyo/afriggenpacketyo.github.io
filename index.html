          <h2>Archaeological Study Suggests Neanderthals Operated Advanced Fat-Rendering Sites 125,000 Years Ago</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 21:06:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reports that Neanderthals in modern-day Germany were engaged in a sophisticated food preparation process 125,000 years ago, creating what researchers call 'fat factories.' Archaeologists discovered clusters of marrow-rich animal bones that appear to have been systematically smashed and boiled to extract calorie-dense fat. This practice, providing a vital nutritional resource, predates previously known evidence by nearly 100,000 years. The findings suggest Neanderthals had advanced resource management skills, including planning hunts and processing carcasses in specialized locations.</p>

          <h2>Connecticut Law Allowing Swift Sale of Towed Vehicles Faces Criticism for Being Predatory</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Connecticut law permitting towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizure is drawing criticism for its predatory nature. Residents argue that the law disproportionately affects working-class and low-income individuals who cannot afford the high fees to retrieve their cars on such short notice. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, is accused of specifically targeting these neighborhoods, with one apartment complex reporting over 1,000 cars towed in two years. The company owner defends the practice as enforcing the rules of private properties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently passed bill does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims, but instead introduces a new temporary deduction for seniors. The legislation provides a 'bonus' deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below certain thresholds, which can be applied to their total income. Policy experts note this measure offers some relief but primarily benefits higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients who already pay no federal tax will see no change. Concerns remain that this could increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a massive explosion and fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California. The discovery was made after coroner's personnel gained access to the site, though the remains have not yet been identified. Seven people were reported unaccounted for following the incident, which destroyed multiple structures and sparked grass fires. Investigations revealed the facility was operating without the required local licenses to store fireworks, and the federal ATF has joined the probe into the cause.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records from a naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. The ruling clarified an earlier order, stating a lower court's injunction preventing the removals was no longer enforceable. This decision is a significant development in the administration's policy of deporting migrants to third countries with which they have no connection. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, expressing grave concerns that the migrants could face torture or death upon arrival in the politically unstable nation.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton near the surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters to burn that fat, sequestering the carbon. This seasonal migration process stores as much carbon as the annual emissions of about 55 million gasoline-powered cars. The discovery highlights a crucial, previously underestimated natural process for mitigating global warming, even as threats to these creatures grow.</p>

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, but the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. The Bayern Munich fullback, who has a history of two ACL injuries, left the field in tears during the first half after an apparent knee injury. Goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller secured the win for the eight-time champions, but the loss of their captain could be a significant blow. Gwinn is scheduled for an MRI to determine the extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order that mandates higher entry fees for international tourists visiting U.S. national parks, with the additional revenue intended for infrastructure improvements. The order also gives U.S. residents preferential treatment in park access systems like lotteries and revokes a 2017 memorandum promoting diversity and inclusion in the management of public lands. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending government diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, reversing initiatives from the Obama and Biden administrations that aimed to tell more inclusive stories within the park system.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience outlines five types of food he avoids giving his children to promote long-term heart health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemicals in the bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are linked to heart disease. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends wholesome alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team narrowly defeated India by five runs in a dramatic T20 match, keeping the series alive. Needing 12 runs from the final over, India fell short as England's Lauren Bell secured the final wicket on the last ball. England's victory was propelled by a powerful opening partnership from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, though the team then suffered a dramatic collapse, losing nine wickets for just 31 runs. A crucial bowling spell from Lauren Filer, who took two key wickets, turned the game back in England's favor during India's chase.</p>
