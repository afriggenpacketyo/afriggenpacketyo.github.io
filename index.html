        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of regional banks like Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance, along with investment bank Jefferies, dropped significantly on Thursday. The decline was fueled by growing concerns over souring loans, particularly in the opaque private credit market, following the bankruptcies of two auto-industry-related companies. Zions reported a large charge-off from bad loans, and Western Alliance alleged fraud by a borrower, rattling investor confidence. Prominent figures like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that these incidents might indicate a more widespread problem, leading to a broad sell-off in the financial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. military flew three B-52 long-range bombers on missions in the Caribbean Sea, approximately 150 miles north of Venezuela's coast. This action is part of the Trump administration's ongoing strategy to exert pressure on the government of President Nicolás Maduro. The flight follows a significant buildup of U.S. military assets in the region, including warships and thousands of personnel. Tensions have been high, with the U.S. indicting Maduro for narco-terrorism and recently conducting airstrikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the area.</p>

Newman advised aspiring individuals not to wait for external permission or approval but to find confidence within themselves. Now a successful model and influencer with major brand partnerships, she reflects on overcoming the pressure to choose between being an athlete or a model, embracing both roles.</p>

This partnership is part of a broader trend of major tech companies investing heavily in the infrastructure required for their artificial intelligence initiatives. Oracle also projected substantial growth in its AI-powered database revenue, signaling strong demand beyond its well-known customer, OpenAI.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an aid organization supported by the U.S. and Israel, has suspended its operations in Gaza following the recent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The group, which has faced criticism after hundreds of Palestinians were killed near its distribution sites, stated its final delivery was last Friday. The shutdown of its northernmost site was due to it no longer being in IDF-controlled territory. Despite the pause, UN data shows that the overall volume of aid collected from crossings has not significantly changed, though challenges like looting and logistical issues persist.</p>

Both individuals were ultimately banned from the ballpark for life by the Brewers organization for their conduct during the incident. Fosado, a U.S. Navy veteran, later expressed some sympathy for the woman, suggesting alcohol may have been a factor and that the consequences were harsh.</p>

          <p>Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has begun debating a bill to reintroduce a form of military service, initially on a voluntary basis. The proposal aims to modernize and expand the Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, in response to heightened security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The plan involves sending a mandatory questionnaire to all 18-year-old men to gauge their interest in serving. While the current bill focuses on voluntary recruitment, there is contentious discussion about implementing a mandatory component, such as a lottery system, if volunteer numbers prove insufficient to meet defense goals.</p>

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, many American consumers are not seeing a corresponding drop in their credit card APRs. A report from CardRatings.com found that while the Fed lowered its benchmark rate, the average credit card rate barely declined, remaining over 24% for many. Experts explain that card rates are influenced by multiple factors, including market competition and individual credit scores, not just the Fed's actions. For consumers carrying debt, this means borrowing costs remain high, with analysts noting that even a proportional rate cut would offer minimal financial relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has accused the United States of creating "unnecessary misunderstanding and panic" by exaggerating the impact of Beijing's new controls on rare earth mineral exports. The spokesperson stated that the U.S. interpretation seriously distorts China's measures. Despite the sharp rhetoric, Beijing also indicated it remains open to trade talks to resolve the dispute, which has escalated tensions and led to U.S. threats of 100% tariffs. The U.S. relies heavily on China for rare earths, which are critical for technology manufacturing, and the administration is actively working to establish an independent domestic supply chain.</p>

          <p>Fans of Israeli football club Maccabi Tel Aviv will not be permitted to attend their upcoming Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. The decision was made by the local Safety Advisory Group, supported by West Midlands Police, due to concerns about the ability to manage potential protests and ensure public safety. The police classified the match as "high risk," citing intelligence and previous incidents of violent clashes involving the team's supporters in Amsterdam. Aston Villa stated that the safety of attendees and local residents was the primary factor in the decision to prohibit away fans.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged two real estate executives in unrelated cases with misappropriating millions of dollars from California's Homekey initiative, a program designed to combat homelessness. In one case, Steven Taylor is accused of fraudulently purchasing a property and reselling it to a nonprofit at a vastly inflated price using state funds. In the second case, Cody Holmes, the former CFO of an affordable housing developer, was arrested for allegedly submitting fake financial statements and using grant money for personal luxuries.

          <p>A new analysis by S&P Global estimates that President Trump's tariffs will cost businesses worldwide over $1.2 trillion in 2025. The report suggests this figure is conservative and that the majority of the financial burden will not be absorbed by companies but will instead be passed on to consumers. According to the analysis, consumers will bear roughly two-thirds of the cost through higher prices for goods. This finding challenges the administration's assertion that foreign exporters would primarily pay for the duties and highlights the significant economic impact of the ongoing trade policies on both corporate profits and household expenses.

          <p>An effort by Senate Republicans to pass a full-year funding bill for the Department of Defense failed to advance after being blocked by Democrats. The procedural vote of 50-44 fell short of the 60 votes needed, representing a setback for the GOP's strategy to fund parts of the government during the ongoing shutdown. Democrats argued against passing the defense bill in isolation, insisting that it be paired with funding for other domestic priorities.

However, the government also faced record-high costs for servicing the national debt, with interest payments totaling over $1.2 trillion for the year. The deficit-to-GDP ratio is estimated at 5.9%, a figure that remains historically high for a period outside of major economic distress. (not investment advice)</p>
