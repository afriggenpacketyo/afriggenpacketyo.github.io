          <p>Alek Hermon shares the story of a nurse named Ray who provided profound comfort during the most difficult week of his life. While Hermon's father was in a coma following a traumatic brain injury, Ray was the nurse on the early morning shift. After the family made the difficult decision to remove life support, and Hermon was feeling utterly alone, Ray ran to him and embraced him in a moment of shared, deep grief. This act of compassion from a near-stranger left a lasting impression on Hermon about human connection in times of suffering.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 25 countries, including the U.K., Canada, and Japan, has issued a joint statement demanding an immediate end to the war in Gaza. The statement strongly condemns Israel's actions, citing the "inhumane killing of civilians" and the "drip feeding of aid," which it calls dangerous and unacceptable under international law. The nations also called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas, asserting that a negotiated ceasefire is the best path forward to resolve the escalating humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the borrowing limits for federal student loans, which vary based on factors like dependency status and year in school. For dependent undergraduates, the lifetime limit is $31,000, while independent undergraduates can borrow up to $57,500. Since these amounts may not cover the full cost of attendance, which averages over $38,000 annually, students often need to seek other funding sources. When federal loans are insufficient, private student loans from banks or online lenders can help bridge the financial gap.</p>

Scientific research suggests that overcoming this behavioral addiction requires a multi-faceted approach rather than relying on willpower alone. Effective, evidence-based methods include creating physical distance from the device, reducing notifications, using self-control apps, and replacing screen time with activities like exercise. For severe cases, therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address the root causes of the addiction.</p>
