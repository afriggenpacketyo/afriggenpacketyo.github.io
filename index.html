          <p>In an interview, Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska outlined his perspective on the upcoming summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents. He suggested that a successful preliminary outcome would be securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, which could then pave the way for more complex negotiations involving allies. Sullivan emphasized that the meeting is a result of economic pressure from sanctions and highlighted Alaska's strategic military and energy significance as a projection of American strength. He also asserted that Alaska's resource development is crucial for both the state's economy and U.S. national security, contrasting the current administration's approach with the previous one.</p>

          <p>West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of hundreds of their National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. This action supports the Trump administration's federalization of the city's local police forces in an effort to address crime and homelessness. The move has drawn mixed reactions, with some Republican governors expressing support while others, like Vermont's, have declined, viewing it as an improper use of the Guard for domestic law enforcement. The deployment signifies a significant increase in federal control over the district, with officials indicating the troops may be armed but will not be making arrests.</p>

          <p>For over four decades, glaciologist Mauri Pelto has been meticulously measuring the retreat of glaciers in Washington's North Cascade Mountains, a project that has documented a 40% reduction in ice. He is joined by his daughter, Jill Pelto, an artist who translates this scientific data into compelling watercolor paintings that visualize the impacts of climate change. Their collaborative work aims to make the stark realities of glacier loss, a critical issue for global freshwater supply and sea levels, more accessible and emotionally resonant to the public.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but remains a significant threat, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The National Hurricane Center has issued considerable flash flood warnings, with several inches of rain already recorded and more expected, creating risks of landslides. While the storm is forecast to turn north and steer clear of the U.S. mainland, it is expected to generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast. Tropical storm warnings are also in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>

          <p>Black mayors from several major U.S. cities are pushing back against the administration's characterization of their communities as "lawless" and in need of federal intervention. Leaders from cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore are highlighting significant, often historic, declines in violent crime, attributing the success to community-based violence prevention programs and strategic local policing. They argue that the narrative of rampant crime is a politically motivated "dog whistle" that overlooks their achievements in making their cities safer. The mayors are using the federal takeover in Washington, D.C., as an opportunity to amplify their own data-driven success stories.</p>

The union chairman alleged that commanders were directing officers to downgrade felony offenses to lesser charges to create a more favorable impression of crime trends. These accusations followed the suspension of a police commander for allegedly falsifying data, providing a contentious backdrop to the administration's justification for the federalization. The White House has seized on these claims, asserting that official statistics are phony and do not reflect the reality of crime in the city.</p>

          <p>Following the federal takeover of policing in Washington, D.C., mayors of other Democratic-run cities are preparing for the possibility of similar actions in their own jurisdictions. City leaders in places like Seattle and Minneapolis are coordinating with their police chiefs and city attorneys to develop legal and operational plans to resist what they see as a potential illegal usurpation of local control. They argue that the administration is using crime as a pretext to create chaos and override local authority. These mayors are working to defend their governance while emphasizing their own successes in reducing violent crime through local initiatives.</p>

          <p>Transgender athlete Evie Parts has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and Swarthmore College, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team. The lawsuit argues that the NCAA, as a private organization, cannot override federal and state anti-discrimination laws like Title IX with its policy restricting transgender athletes. Parts was removed from the team on the same day the NCAA implemented its new policy, which followed a presidential executive order on the issue. The complaint details the severe emotional distress caused by the decision, which was later reversed, allowing her to compete again before graduating.</p>

The show of unity follows Zelenskyy's exclusion from the recent U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska.

They argue the White House's narrative dismisses the progress made in cities that have invested in these local strategies.

          <h2>German Coalition Government Divided on Reinstating Compulsory Military Service</h2>

          <p>Germany's coalition government is split on how to increase the size of its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to meet NATO targets. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), led by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, are pushing a draft bill to make voluntary service more attractive. However, members of the center-right CDU/CSU alliance argue that relying on volunteers is insufficient given the current security climate and are pushing for a return to compulsory military service, which was suspended in 2011. The debate centers on whether a voluntary system can attract enough recruits or if some form of mandatory service is necessary to bolster national defense.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man from Long Beach, California, has been rescued after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall for two days. Ryan Wardwell was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the river's "extreme hydraulics" pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. After he was reported missing, a search operation was launched, and rescuers located him by flying a drone behind the falls. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully hoisted him to safety in what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the cost of higher education approaches $100,000 per year at some private universities, a small number of U.S. colleges offer a completely tuition-free education. This list includes the five U.S. military service academies, which require a post-graduation service commitment. It also features unique civilian institutions like Berea College and College of the Ozarks, which are "work colleges" where students work on campus in exchange for their education. While these schools eliminate tuition costs, they maintain highly selective admissions standards and demand significant commitment from their students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three years after the launch of ChatGPT, generative AI has become a standard tool for college students, fundamentally altering the landscape of higher education. Students now routinely use AI for tasks ranging from summarizing readings to completing assignments, viewing it as a pragmatic way to manage heavy workloads and focus on career-oriented goals. Many faculty members, however, seem unaware of how deeply integrated AI has become and have been slow to adapt their teaching methods beyond reverting to in-class, handwritten assignments. This growing disconnect poses significant challenges to academic integrity and the very definition of a college education.</p>

          <p>Richard Kahlenberg, a key witness in the Supreme Court case that ended race-based affirmative action, is now advocating for class-based preferences in college admissions. He argues this approach legally fosters both racial and economic diversity, as minority students are disproportionately from lower-income backgrounds. However, he expresses concern that the Trump administration, which is now scrutinizing university admissions data, may oppose class-based policies if they result in increased racial diversity. Kahlenberg suggests that such a move would be a political mistake, as class-based affirmative action also benefits the white working-class students who form a core part of the Republican base.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster has implemented a series of "brotherhood meetings" during training camp to build chemistry for a team with 55 new players and eight new coaches. In these sessions, coaches and players share personal stories and vulnerabilities, a process Foster believes has brought the team closer together. The meetings featured coaches discussing their anxieties and players opening up in smaller group settings. This focus on connection and a collective mindset has led to a new team motto for the season: "We over me."</p>

          <p>In the 11 days since the UK and France implemented a new "one in, one out" migrant agreement, more than 2,500 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one person with a strong asylum case, but no removals have yet taken place. The continued arrivals, with over 28,000 reaching the UK this year, raise questions about the immediate deterrent effect of the new policy. Smugglers are reportedly using larger, more crowded boats, increasing the danger for those making the journey.</p>

          <p>Several universities in China are facing intense online criticism for hosting events with Darius Longarino, a research scholar from Yale Law School. The backlash stems from social media users highlighting Longarino's past posts on X that were critical of Beijing's policies in the Xinjiang region. In response to the nationalist outcry, at least three universities have removed online announcements about the lectures he gave, which focused on topics like sexual harassment in Chinese courts. The controversy underscores the growing sensitivity and scrutiny surrounding academic exchanges in China, particularly for scholars who have commented on politically charged issues.</p>

          <p>A veteran LAPD Internal Affairs detective, Sgt. Joseph Lloyd, has earned the nickname "The Grim Reaper" among some officers who accuse him of twisting facts to end careers. Supporters, however, maintain he is a meticulous and dogged investigator entrusted with the department's most sensitive cases, including corruption within elite units. This profile explores the pitched debate over his methods and the LAPD's disciplinary system, which critics claim is unfair. Officers who have been investigated by Lloyd describe his interrogation style as intimidating, while his backers praise his willingness to hold fellow cops accountable.</p>
