            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, during a White House meeting with President Trump, stated he would not return Kilmar Ábrego García, a man mistakenly deported from the US to a mega-prison in El Salvador. The US Supreme Court had ruled the Trump administration should facilitate Ábrego García's return, but Bukele asserted he would not "smuggle a terrorist" into the US. The US government conceded the deportation was an "administrative error," but also claims Ábrego García is a gang member, a claim his lawyer denies. This refusal highlights tensions between US legal rulings and foreign policy considerations.</p>

This display highlights the strong social bonds and communication skills of elephants, who can use infrasonic rumbles to warn each other of danger. The zoo also noted that the elephants had also performed this protective measure during the 2010 Baja California earthquake.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing approximately $2.3 billion in federal funds to Harvard University after the school refused to comply with demands to crack down on antisemitism and alleged civil rights violations. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, stated the university would not comply with demands to dismantle diversity programming and limit student protests. The administration's demands included broad government and leadership reforms, a ban on face masks, and the closure of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.</p>

            <p>Five years after the death of celebrated Chinese scientist Nongjian Tao, questions linger surrounding the circumstances of his passing. Tao, a renowned nanoscientist at Arizona State University, was found dead after an apparent fall from a parking garage. While authorities ruled his death a suicide, citing work-related stress, some colleagues remain skeptical. Tao's work involved groundbreaking research in nanoscience, and his death has left a void in the scientific community.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, in a meeting with President Trump, vowed not to return a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego García, who was mistakenly deported to a Salvadorian mega-prison. Bukele stated he would not "smuggle a terrorist" into the US, despite the US Supreme Court ruling the administration should facilitate his return. The Trump administration has acknowledged the deportation was an error but maintains Abrego García is a gang member. The situation highlights the complexities of immigration policy and international relations.</p>

            <p>Research indicates a nearly one-third decrease in play and musical productions by major UK subsidized theaters compared to a decade prior. Funding cuts, rising costs, and the pandemic's impact are cited as primary reasons. Some theaters now focus on larger-scale co-productions to mitigate costs, but this has reduced opportunities for smaller, riskier productions and emerging artists. Concerns are raised about the shrinking pipeline for young talent and the industry's financial pressures.</p>

            <p>A CNBC survey reveals that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to bring supply chains back to the U.S., as companies find it too costly. The majority of respondents believe reshoring would double their costs, leading them to relocate supply chains to lower-tariff countries instead. Automation would be a major component if manufacturing returned to the U.S. The survey also indicates concerns about consumer demand, raw material prices, and the Trump administration's strategy.</p>
