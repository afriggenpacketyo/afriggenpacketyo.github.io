          <p>US prosecutors are considering dropping a criminal charge against Boeing related to the 737 Max crashes, potentially settling the case with a non-prosecution agreement. This move would avoid a trial after a judge rejected an earlier settlement where Boeing agreed to plead guilty. Families of the crash victims are "deeply disappointed," arguing that Boeing has never faced trial for the 346 lives lost. Lawyers representing the families are criticizing the DOJ's plan, stating that it would allow the company to avoid accountability with only a financial penalty.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense is employing a "mutual violence" strategy in his sexual assault trial, suggesting his relationship with accuser Cassie Ventura involved violence on both sides. Legal experts argue that "mutual abuse" is not a valid legal defense, as abuse is about power and control, not just physical violence. The defense may attempt to reframe the violence as consensual, similar to the Trevor Bauer case, to undermine the accuser's claims of being a victim. This approach could resonate with the public, who may find it difficult to reconcile Combs' celebrity status with accusations of abusive behavior.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the Fed will reduce its headcount by 10% over the next few years, offering deferred resignation to some older employees. This decision aims to consolidate functions, modernize practices, and ensure the Fed is right-sized to meet its mission. The move comes amid pressure from the Trump administration to cut costs across civil service agencies. The Fed's 2023 annual report stated it had just under 24,000 employees, meaning the reduction will bring the number below 22,000.</p>
