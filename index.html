          <p>A SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during routine testing at the Starbase facility in Texas, resulting in a large fireball but no reported injuries. SpaceX confirmed the incident, stating that a "major anomaly" occurred while the rocket was on a test stand, and that safety protocols were in place. Local authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion, which occurred during preparations for a future launch flight. Starship is central to Elon Musk's plans for lunar and Martian colonization, and the rocket is slated to play a crucial role in NASA's Artemis missions, as well as launching robots to Mars by 2026, so this explosion represents a setback. Despite previous launch attempts ending in fiery failures, Musk remains optimistic about Starship's potential, and the company is dedicated to finding out the root cause of the explosion.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided against dissolving the lower house of parliament for the time being, according to a lawmaker. This decision makes same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely. The ruling bloc led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party does not hold a majority in the House of Representatives. A no-confidence motion, if passed, would require the prime minister to dissolve the 465-member chamber or the Cabinet to resign en masse within 10 days.</p>

          <p>Organizers of Juneteenth events across the country are facing new challenges, including safety concerns and decreased corporate support, but remain committed to celebrating the holiday. In Bend, Oregon, the annual festival was initially canceled due to safety concerns but was revived as a smaller, indoor event. In West Virginia, state employees will no longer receive Juneteenth as a paid holiday, prompting organizers to move the Charleston event to a Friday. Despite these hurdles, organizers like Willie Sims in Nashville emphasize the importance of continuing the celebrations, which have been a part of communities since 1866.</p>

          <p>With a significant heat wave expected to hit much of the United States, health experts recommend taking precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses. Checking the heat index, wearing lightweight clothing, seeking shade, and staying hydrated are crucial steps to staying safe in hot weather. Recognizing the symptoms of heat exhaustion and taking breaks are also important, particularly for vulnerable populations like seniors and children. Experts emphasize that even without a heat advisory, caution should be taken when outside on a hot day, and it is crucial to plan activities accordingly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has eliminated the VA Servicing Purchase program (VASP), a program that provided low-interest-rate mortgages to veterans struggling to keep up with their home loans. The decision has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, as well as veterans who fear losing their homes. The VA argues the program is too costly, while critics contend that its removal leaves veterans with fewer options than other homeowners facing similar financial difficulties. Congress is considering legislation to replace VASP with a "partial claim" program, but it is uncertain when such a program might be implemented, leaving many veterans in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida is working to combat the U.S. shortage of air traffic controllers through an accelerated training program. The FAA is currently short over 3,000 certified controllers, leading to mandatory overtime and six-day workweeks for existing personnel. Embry-Riddle's program mirrors the FAA Academy's curriculum and allows students to begin medical and background checks early, potentially skipping the academy altogether. Graduates are eager to fill the staffing gaps and are not intimidated by the job's stresses, and with additional financial incentives and streamlined hiring processes, the FAA hopes to attract more candidates and address the ongoing staffing crisis.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Icarus suggests that a passing star could potentially destabilize the solar system, possibly affecting Earth's orbit. Computer simulations indicate that passing stars are the most likely cause of instability over the next four billion years. While the probability of Earth colliding with another planet or being ejected from the solar system is low (approximately 0.2%), it is still higher than previously thought. The gravitational tug of a passing star could also impact other celestial bodies, such as Pluto and Mars, although scientists emphasize that such events are not probable.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has led to a significant increase in insurance costs for ships navigating the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.

War risk insurance rates have also risen for the Red Sea, and coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%.

He is aiming to protect Japan's national interests without compromising its role as a defender of free trade.
