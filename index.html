          <p>A manhunt for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran, has entered its third day in Montana. Brown is suspected of fatally shooting four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, a small town where he was reportedly a regular and knew the victims. Authorities consider him armed and dangerous, and his family has stated he has a history of mental illness and PTSD. The search involves local, state, and federal agencies in the rugged terrain surrounding the town.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has indicated that the recently announced tariff rates for over 60 trading partners are "pretty much set." The Trump administration's executive order imposes a baseline 10% tariff on all imports starting August 7, with higher rates for some countries like Canada. Greer stated that while some deals have been made, the president compares potential concessions against the tariff levels needed to reduce the trade deficit, sometimes favoring the tariff over a deal.

          <p>Despite previous public statements by White House advisor Stephen Miller about a goal to arrest 3,000 people per day, the Trump administration has denied the existence of a daily arrest quota in a recent court filing. The denial came in a lawsuit alleging unconstitutional immigration sweeps in Southern California. The government's lawyers argued that while a "goal" may have been discussed, no such directive has been issued as a matter of policy to DHS or ICE.</p>

          <p>With a self-imposed deadline for a new trade deal having passed, the U.S. and Canada remain locked in a six-month tariff war, creating uncertainty for businesses. While Canada now faces a 35% U.S. tariff rate, a significant buffer exists as nearly 90% of its exports can still cross duty-free under the existing USMCA/CUSMA agreement. Analysts suggest this gives Canada negotiating leverage, as it can wait for American businesses and consumers to feel the economic pain from the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
