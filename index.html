        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new tariffs on goods from over 60 countries, set to take effect in seven days. The executive order details rates ranging from 10% to as high as 41% for Syria, solidifying a key part of the president's trade agenda after multiple deadline extensions. While some nations that recently struck deals with the U.S. have their agreed-upon rates reflected, most trading partners will face higher costs. Economists note this move increases economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, despite the administration's claims that the tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing and generate significant federal revenue.</p>

          <p>The White House has issued a revised list of tariff rates for dozens of countries, with new duties ranging from 10% to 41% and a specific 40% levy on any goods transshipped to evade duties. The executive order provides some relief for certain Asian nations like Thailand and Malaysia with lowered rates, while confirming higher tariffs for others, including a 35% rate on Canada. This action modifies the administration's April tariff directive and comes ahead of a self-imposed deadline. The announcement led to declines in Asian markets, reflecting investor concern over the continued trade uncertainty and its potential global economic impact.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has postponed the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling delays the termination until a hearing in November, providing temporary relief for individuals, many of whom have resided in the U.S. for over two decades. The judge criticized the administration's rationale, stating the decision appeared preordained rather than based on an objective review of country conditions. The Department of Homeland Security has argued that the conditions that initially justified TPS, such as natural disasters, no longer exist in these countries.</p>

          <p>Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has reportedly requested a trade as contract extension negotiations with the team have stalled. McLaurin, who has one year left on his current deal, is seeking a contract that would place him among the highest-paid receivers in the league, with an estimated value around $32 million per season. Despite the trade request, he reported to training camp to avoid daily fines, though he is currently on the physically unable to perform list with an ankle injury. The Commanders have publicly stated their desire to keep the star player, who has recorded over 1,000 receiving yards in each of his last five seasons.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made over 109,000 arrests in the first five months of President Trump's second term, a 120% increase from the same period in the previous year. The majority of these arrests occurred in Southern and border states, with Texas accounting for nearly a quarter of the total. Most of the individuals arrested were from Latin American and Caribbean countries, reflecting broader immigration trends. Experts attribute the geographic concentration to state and local law enforcement cooperation with ICE, as the agency executes its mandate to broaden immigration enforcement across the country.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell suggests that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event. Researchers analyzed hundreds of genomes from wild and cultivated potatoes to solve the long-standing puzzle of the vegetable's origin. The findings indicate that an ancient tomato provided a key gene for forming tubers, which combined with a gene from a wild, non-tuber-producing potato relative from Chile. This genetic mixing allowed the potato to develop its characteristic starch-rich tubers, demonstrating how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has found that China is circumventing U.S. sanctions by purchasing Iranian oil through a clandestine network of tankers known as a "dark fleet." These ships conduct ship-to-ship transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, often with their identification transponders turned off to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which reportedly generated as much as $70 billion for Iran last year, helps fund the Iranian regime and its nuclear program. Despite new U.S. sanctions targeting this activity, the investigation observed numerous transfers, indicating that the mutually beneficial trade between Iran and China is intensifying.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased tariffs on most Canadian goods from 25% to 35%, effective Friday, formalizing the decision with an executive order. The White House cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl across the border as the primary reason for the hike. However, President Trump also linked the move to Canada's recent decision to recognize a Palestinian state, suggesting it would make a trade deal difficult. The move escalates trade tensions with one of America's largest trading partners, placing Canada in a vulnerable economic position given that about 75% of its exports go to the United States.</p>

          <p>A fatal car crash in Cornwall involving a 79-year-old woman has intensified the debate in the UK over the adequacy of driving regulations for older adults. The victim's daughter argues that current rules, which rely on self-declaration of medical conditions and a simple license renewal every three years after age 70, are unsafe. With an aging population, the number of elderly drivers is increasing, and statistics show they are at a higher risk of being killed or seriously injured. While some advocate for mandatory medical checks and reporting by doctors, others emphasize that driving is a lifeline for many seniors, especially in rural areas.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is considering a special election on November 4 to have voters approve new congressional maps, a move aimed at countering President Trump's efforts to redraw districts in Republican-led states. Newsom frames this potential gerrymandering as a direct response to what he calls a plan to "rig the game" and maintain GOP control of the House in the midterms. Under the proposal, the legislature would place the new maps on the ballot for voter approval, which would remain in effect until 2030. Newsom stated that while the cost of a special election is a factor, the price of preserving democracy is "priceless."</p>

          <p>Florida has set a new modern-era state record for the most executions in a single year after putting a ninth inmate to death on Thursday. Edward Zakrzewski, convicted of killing his wife and two young children in 1994, was executed by lethal injection at Florida State Prison. This total surpasses the state's previous high of eight executions in 2014 and makes Florida the state with the most executions in the U.S. this year. Two more executions are already scheduled for August, as opponents continue to protest the state's aggressive use of the death penalty, citing issues like non-unanimous jury recommendations in past cases.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a quiet trade deadline, making only minor additions by acquiring reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call. Unlike other National League contenders who made blockbuster deals, the Dodgers' front office opted to show faith in their current roster rather than pursuing high-priced talent. The team addressed its main needs in the bullpen and outfield without giving up significant prospect capital. Management is betting on the return of injured players and a performance rebound from slumping stars to carry them through the rest of the season and defend their World Series title.</p>

          <p>Will Lansing, the CEO of Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO), has defended his company's pricing against criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), arguing that the cost of a FICO score is not a barrier to homeownership. His comments follow the FHFA's decision to allow mortgage lenders to use a rival score from VantageScore, a move the agency's head said was a response to FICO's price hikes. Lansing stated that a FICO score costs just $4.95 out of thousands in closing costs and that his company's model remains the industry standard due to its superior predictive power, despite the new competitive pressure.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has postponed its planned closure for 45 days following a massive outpouring of community support. Since the closure was announced, the restaurant has seen hours-long lines of customers wanting one last meal, leading to a dramatic jump in sales. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service while he actively seeks a new buyer who will respect the landmark's historic value. While grateful for the surge, Moses noted that the underlying business challenges that prompted the closure, including increased costs and post-pandemic demand issues, remain a concern for the long term.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration is claiming victory after implementing a new global tariff structure without immediate market chaos, the long-term economic and political repercussions remain uncertain. The new regime, which sets higher baseline tariffs for most U.S. trading partners, has generated significant revenue but also risks raising consumer prices and squeezing household incomes. This article suggests that while the most dire predictions of a trade war have been averted for now, the policy shift could fundamentally realign global trade. Long-time allies may seek new economic partnerships, potentially undermining America's central role in the global economy over the long term.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming UK Supreme Court ruling could determine whether millions of motorists are eligible for compensation over mis-sold car finance deals. The court will decide on cases concerning hidden commission payments made to car dealers, which may have unlawfully inflated interest rates for consumers. The financial regulator has already banned one type of these arrangements, but this ruling could widen the scope of unlawful practices, potentially leading to billions of pounds in payouts. The case has significant economic implications, with major lenders setting aside vast sums and the government expressing concern over the potential impact on the car market.</p>

Meanwhile, JD.com is investing 1 billion yuan to establish 10,000 of its own 7Fresh kitchens over the next three years.

          <p>Colombia's government has reported a significant 43% increase in deforestation in 2024 compared to the previous year, reversing a recent downward trend. The Amazon rainforest region was the most affected, accounting for over 65% of the total 113,608 hectares of forest destroyed. Authorities attribute the spike to a combination of factors, including land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, the expansion of illicit coca crops, and wildfires exacerbated by a severe drought. Despite the sharp increase, the overall level of deforestation remains below the peaks seen in 2021, though the reversal is a major setback for conservation efforts.</p>

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt expressed doubt that an extension was being considered, though she deferred to the Treasury Secretary, who is leading the negotiations. She highlighted that the current trade program is already reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China.
