          <h2>Senate Approves Modest Spending Reduction Bill Amid Republican Divisions</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly passed a revised $9 billion spending cuts package, a key priority for the Trump administration. The legislation, which targets funds for foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, revealed significant rifts within the Republican party. Several GOP senators, including former leader Mitch McConnell and Lisa Murkowski, initially opposed procedural votes, creating dramatic tensions before the bill ultimately advanced. This contentious process highlights the difficulty the administration faces in enacting even modest fiscal reductions, despite controlling the chamber. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike struck the Holy Family Church, the only Catholic parish in the Gaza Strip, resulting in three deaths and multiple injuries, including the parish priest. The church was providing shelter to hundreds of displaced civilians, both Christian and Muslim. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that "stray ammunition" hit the church by accident and expressed deep regret for the tragedy. The event drew condemnation from international figures, including Pope Leo XIV and Italy's Prime Minister, who renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire and protection of civilians.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the U.S. Federal Reserve's function and the ongoing friction between President Trump and its chair, Jerome Powell. The Fed operates independently to manage monetary policy with a dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. Trump, who appointed Powell, has repeatedly criticized him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate economic growth. The conflict also extends to a dispute over the cost and scope of renovations at the Fed's headquarters in Washington, D.C. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted a series of raids in Sacramento, including at a Home Depot, in a move widely seen as a direct challenge to California's sanctuary state policies. A top Border Patrol official recorded a video in front of the state capitol, stating, "There is no such thing as a sanctuary state." The operation, which resulted in 11 arrests, was immediately condemned by Governor Gavin Newsom's office as an act of "illegal racial profiling." The raids occurred despite a recent federal court injunction limiting such actions.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed a previous ban, granting Juul authorization to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market. The agency concluded that the products can benefit public health by helping adult smokers switch from more harmful traditional cigarettes. This decision is a major milestone for Juul, which has faced years of litigation and public criticism for its alleged role in the teen vaping epidemic. Anti-tobacco advocates strongly condemned the move, calling it a step in the wrong direction.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was primarily driven by a slowdown in the rapid increase of rice prices after the government released stockpiles. Despite this moderation, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. This maintains pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates, even as the country faces economic growth concerns due to U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS announced it is canceling "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in May 2026, ending the host's decade-long run and retiring the historic late-night franchise. The network described the move as a "purely financial decision," acknowledging the challenging economic backdrop for broadcast television as younger audiences shift to short-form content on digital platforms. Despite being the top-rated late-night show for nine seasons, the program was reportedly losing money, signaling a major shift in the entertainment landscape.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a major class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders.

          <p>Consumers are facing record-high beef prices this summer, with the cost of ground beef and steaks soaring due to a convergence of market forces. The primary driver is a historically small U.S. cattle herd, which has been shrinking for decades and was further reduced by recent droughts. Strong consumer demand, combined with potential supply pressures from new pests in Mexico and the prospect of widespread tariffs, suggests that prices are unlikely to decrease significantly in the near future.

          <p>This article provides a medical explanation of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), the condition recently diagnosed in President Trump. CVI is a common circulatory issue where valves in leg veins are weakened, making it difficult for blood to return to the heart and leading to symptoms like swelling, varicose veins, and skin discoloration. Medical experts confirm the White House's assessment that the condition is generally benign and manageable, often treated with non-surgical methods like compression stockings, leg elevation, and maintaining an active lifestyle.</p>
