He shared the news after completing his world tour, explaining he wanted to be transparent about his struggles so they are not misinterpreted by fans. Timberlake stated that the joy of performing outweighed the physical stress, and he is glad he decided to continue with his tour despite the health challenges.

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's handling of numerous emergency appeals, stating that as presidents increasingly use executive orders, courts must respond. Speaking at a judicial conference, he noted that the court has increased its process for these cases, sometimes scheduling emergency oral arguments to ensure proper review. Kavanaugh also commented on the strong collegiality among the justices, saying that even in disagreement, they are patriots engaging thoughtfully on difficult issues. He emphasized that criticism is an expected part of the job for a judge, similar to a referee in sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is weighing a major legal challenge to President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs. During arguments, judges sharply questioned the administration's claim of authority, noting the law does not mention tariffs and that such a broad interpretation could upset the entire U.S. trade framework established by Congress. The case, brought by states and small businesses, tests a key part of Trump's economic agenda and is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, regardless of the outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley has officially launched his campaign for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, a week after receiving a strong endorsement from former President Donald Trump. His entry sets up a high-stakes battle against former two-term Democratic Governor Roy Cooper for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis. The race is expected to be one of the most competitive and expensive in the 2026 election cycle, with Democrats seeing an opportunity to flip a key seat in the battleground state. Cooper's campaign has already reported significant early fundraising success.</p>

          <p>A group of federal judges has publicly detailed a disturbing rise in threats and harassment they have faced, which they link to their rulings and the current political climate. The incidents include credible death threats, menacing voicemails, and a harassment tactic known as "pizza doxxing," where unsolicited pizzas were sent to their homes in the name of a judge's murdered son. The judges attribute the surge in intimidating rhetoric to political leaders who attack the judiciary, creating an environment that emboldens individuals to make threats. They are calling for leaders to tone down their language and respect the rule of law.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has warned that Israel is in danger of becoming internationally isolated due to its actions in the Gaza Strip. Describing the humanitarian situation as "beyond imagination," he stated that Germany has a responsibility to help prevent this isolation. Wadephul urged Israel to demonstrate it is not pursuing a policy of expulsion and to allow sufficient humanitarian aid to enter Gaza to prevent mass deaths. His visit to the region comes as other European nations consider recognizing a Palestinian state, increasing diplomatic pressure on Israel.</p>

          <p>After years of discussion, the Trump administration is proceeding with a plan to build a new grand ballroom at the White House, with construction set to begin in September. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by President Trump himself along with other private donors. The new ballroom will be located in the East Wing and is designed to seat 650 guests, providing a much larger indoor event space than the current East Room. President Trump has long advocated for a permanent ballroom to replace the large tents often used for state dinners.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has solved the long-standing mystery of the potato's origin, revealing that it evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers found that the modern potato was created through a hybridization event between this ancient tomato and a wild, non-tuber-producing species from Chile. A key gene from the tomato parent signaled the plant to form starch-rich tubers, while a gene from the other parent helped control their growth. This discovery demonstrates how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits.</p>

This rule stipulates that if heirs wish to keep the property after the borrower passes away or moves out, they only have to repay either the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever amount is less. This ensures that family members will not be forced to pay more than the home is worth, even if the loan balance has grown larger than the property's value over time.</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation measure watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.6% in June from a year ago, up from May's 2.4% pace. The increase suggests that President Trump's new tariffs on imported goods are beginning to push some prices higher. This data provides context for the Fed's recent decision to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, as inflation remains above its 2% target. The report also showed that consumer spending and after-tax income saw only modest growth for the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately getting booked in four separate matches to improperly affect betting markets, charges that could have resulted in a lifetime ban. While the four main charges were found "not proven," the commission did find Paqueta guilty of two counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation. The verdict vindicates the player, who had maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded that 17 major pharmaceutical companies take action to lower U.S. drug prices within 60 days. In letters sent to firms like Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Johnson & Johnson, he threatened to use "every tool in our arsenal" if they refuse to match their U.S. prices with the lowest price offered in other developed nations. The move revives his "most favored nation" policy and aims to provide immediate relief to American consumers. The announcement caused a sharp drop in the stock prices of the targeted drugmakers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for negotiating a new trade deal with Mexico by an additional 90 days. During this period, the current tariff rates, including a 25% tariff on many goods, will remain in place. The decision was announced after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, with Trump citing the complexities of the cross-border relationship. This extension comes as a broader deadline approaches for dozens of other countries to finalize trade agreements with the U.S. or face the imposition of higher, punitive import duties.

          <p>Consumers in the U.S. could soon see higher prices for European wine and spirits due to new tariffs set to take effect on August 1. A 15% tariff on most EU imports and a 10% levy on UK goods will likely be passed on to consumers, according to distributors. An Italian wine trade group warns that a bottle previously costing $11.50 could rise to around $15. The tariffs are expected to impact a wide range of popular products, and industry groups are actively lobbying for exemptions to avoid significant financial losses and reduced consumer choice.

          <p>According to a CBS News investigation, China is actively evading U.S. sanctions by using a "dark fleet" of oil tankers to secretly purchase crude oil from Iran. This illicit trade involves ship-to-ship transfers in international waters, often with the vessels' identification and tracking transponders turned off to avoid detection. The activity, which props up the Iranian regime with billions in revenue, undermines U.S. foreign policy and its efforts to curb Iran's nuclear program. The investigation recorded an unprecedented number of these transfers, indicating the trade is ramping up.</p>
