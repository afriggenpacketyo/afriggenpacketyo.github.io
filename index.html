          <p>Former President Donald Trump amplified a conspiracy theory by reposting a user's false claim that President Biden was "executed" in 2020 and replaced by a robotic clone. This action continues a pattern of Trump promoting unsubstantiated and outlandish claims, further fueling political division and distrust. The spread of such misinformation can have serious consequences, potentially undermining faith in democratic institutions and processes. This particular theory is a baseless and bizarre claim with no grounding in reality, and the effects of this type of rhetoric are yet to be seen. Optimism surrounding the stability of political information is relatively low.</p>

          <p>Six people were injured in what the FBI is calling a "targeted act of violence" at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado.

Soliman allegedly yelled "free Palestine" during the attack, which is being investigated as an act of terrorism. The victims ranged in age from 67 to 88, with one person in critical condition, and the incident led to the evacuation of three blocks of Pearl Street, as the community expressed sadness and heartbreak over the attack.</p>

          <h2>Universities Cutting Courses May Lead to Subject Cold Spots</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by Universities UK suggests that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as many institutions are struggling to cut costs. A government review is underway to determine how higher education will be funded in the long term in England. Greater collaboration between universities could help institutions become more efficient and avoid isolated decisions about course closures. The Competition and Markets Authority recognizes the financial problems facing universities and aims to support collaboration where possible.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs due to widespread displacement of families. A new report calls for a notification system to alert authorities when a child moves into temporary accommodation. More than 164,000 homeless children are living in temporary accommodation across England, which is the highest number on record. The government says it is investing ¬£1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation.</p>

Odyssey Sims scored a game-high 32 points for the Sparks, but it wasn't enough to secure the win, and the team now faces a challenging road schedule.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate privately owned land without compensation, sparking controversy. The law aims to increase black ownership of land, but critics argue it threatens property rights. The government says compensation will be paid in most cases, with expropriation without compensation occurring in rare circumstances for "public interest." The plan is for owners to receive "just-and-equitable" compensation, a departure from the higher "market value" they have been getting up to now.</p>

          <p>Six people were injured in an attack in Boulder, Colorado, when a man threw an incendiary device into a crowd and yelled ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù, in what the FBI is treating as an ‚Äúact of terrorism‚Äù. The 45-year-old man threw the device into a group of people who had assembled for a peaceful protest for Israeli hostages in Gaza. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of violence, and there is no evidence that the man was connected to a wider group. The attack comes amid heightened tensions in the United States over Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza.</p>
