          <p>China has refuted accusations from the Trump administration that it violated the Geneva trade agreement. Instead, China claims that the U.S. is undermining the deal by imposing export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, and by revoking visas for Chinese students. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that Beijing would take measures to protect its interests if the U.S. continues to damage them. Tensions between the U.S. and China extend beyond trade, with the Pentagon chief warning of China's growing military pressure in the Indo-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six people were injured in an attack at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, during a walk in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails while yelling "free Palestine". The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of violence and terrorism, as Soliman is an Egyptian national whose visa expired in 2023. The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, were outside the Boulder County Courthouse, and one is in critical condition.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks experienced a surge after announcing a A$14 billion merger. The merged entity will acquire all outstanding shares of both companies and is projected to hold A$13.1 billion in real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger aims to unwind a 56-year mutual ownership structure intended to prevent hostile takeovers, but which critics argued suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium.</p>

          <p>Mexico held its first judicial elections, becoming the only nation in the world to select judges and magistrates by popular vote. Supporters believe this is needed to overhaul the judicial system, which is known for corruption and inefficiency, while critics argue it will politicize the judiciary. Voters had to elect around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates. Turnout appeared low, with many voters struggling to choose from hundreds of largely unknown candidates, and some voters expressing disillusionment with the corrupt system.</p>

The SBU security service took a year and a half to organize the strikes, which Zelenskyy called an "absolutely brilliant result."

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate privately owned land without compensation, drawing criticism from US President Donald Trump and local political groups. The government argues the law is necessary to increase black ownership of land and provides for compensation in most cases. Legal experts suggest expropriation without compensation would occur in rare circumstances, such as when land is unused or abandoned, but productive agricultural land would not be affected. The law also aims to provide "just-and-equitable" compensation rather than market value.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer identifies multiple ways in which President Trump's unpredictable policies negatively impact the stock market. He argues that uncertainty surrounding trade, regulations, and government intervention creates a "Trump discount" that holds back various sectors, including technology, retail, pharmaceuticals, and energy. Cramer points to specific examples, such as Nvidia's stock performance and the struggles of retail companies facing tariff pressures. He concludes that the president's derision of business and the lack of predictability undermine investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>
