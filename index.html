          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from the U.S., has returned to face charges of illegally transporting migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for allegedly participating in a years-long conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to the interior of the country. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador's president for agreeing to return Abrego Garcia, who faces a maximum punishment of 10 years' imprisonment for each transported migrant if convicted. His attorney claims the charges are an abuse of power, while prosecutors argue for pre-trial detention due to community danger and flight risk. Optimism surrounding the case is low, given the serious charges and the political tensions involved.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mary Miller is facing widespread condemnation after posting a disparaging comment about a Sikh prayer in the US House. Miller initially misidentified the Sikh Granthi as Muslim, stating it was "deeply troubling" to allow such a prayer. The comments triggered outrage from fellow members of Congress and advocacy groups, who criticized Miller's ignorance and religious intolerance. Miller later deleted the post, but the backlash continues.</p>
