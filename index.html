          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI agents reviewing Jeffrey Epstein's case files were told to specifically "flag" any documents that mentioned Donald Trump. In letters to the Justice Department and FBI, Durbin questioned the motives behind this directive and a haphazard review process involving 1,000 personnel. The allegation adds to the political pressure on the Trump administration regarding the handling and promised release of files related to the deceased sex offender.</p>

The agency is investigating patient deaths linked to the treatment, which is used for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and has a history of controversy regarding its effectiveness. With Elevidys accounting for more than half of the company's revenue, a market withdrawal could be catastrophic for Sarepta, highlighting the significant risks associated with its primary product.

          <p>Mark Sanfratello, now 72, has been extradited to Oregon to face a murder charge in the 1983 death of his then-girlfriend, 27-year-old Teresa Peroni. Peroni was last seen with Sanfratello after a party, and her skull was found years later, but the case remained cold until recently. Investigators reopened the case in 2024, using modern forensic testing and re-interviewing witnesses to gather enough evidence for a grand jury to indict Sanfratello, bringing a potential resolution to the four-decade-old case.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for south-east England, anticipating torrential rain and thunderstorms that could lead to dangerous flash flooding this weekend. More than a month's worth of rain is forecast to fall in just a few hours, with the dry, parched ground from a recent heatwave increasing the risk of severe surface water runoff. The severe weather is expected to cause significant disruption to transport, potential power cuts, and flooding of homes and businesses.</p>

          <p>The European Union has adopted a significant new package of sanctions against Russia, targeting its energy, banking, and military sectors to curtail its ability to fund the war in Ukraine. The measures include a dynamic price cap on Russian oil, a ban on future transactions via Nord Stream pipelines, and sanctions on Russian banks and shadow fleet shipping vessels. The sanctions also restrict entities in China and Turkey for supplying Russia with dual-use technologies, though experts note that enforcement will remain a major challenge.</p>

The judge found that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion was inadequate, particularly for failing to properly consider the project's impact on the giant garter snake, and halted the project pending a new review.</p>

          <p>The nation's 37 tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) are facing a potential existential threat due to proposed budget cuts from the Trump administration. The proposal would slash operations funding for Bureau of Indian Education post-secondary programs by nearly 90%, which could force many TCUs to close. Since these institutions are heavily reliant on federal funding and serve as vital economic and cultural hubs for their communities, the cuts are seen as a direct attack on tribal sovereignty and the government's treaty obligations.</p>
