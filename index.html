          <p>China's three most economically significant cities have recently eased property sector restrictions, aiming to stabilize the industry and invigorate consumer confidence. Analysts believe these measures are crucial for boosting sentiment, though they do not anticipate a rapid market rebound. The property sector's decline profoundly influences over a dozen related industries, making its current slump a major factor in China's broader economic difficulties. While government stimulus has mitigated some impacts, persistent household deleveraging and trade tensions pose risks of prolonged stagnation, underscoring the long-term challenge of fostering a robust consumer recovery and achieving sustained economic stability.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk briefly became the first individual to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion, driven by the rising valuations of his diverse ventures including Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX. This financial milestone significantly solidifies his position as the world's richest person, well ahead of other tech magnates. Tesla's shares have notably climbed this year, with investors reportedly welcoming Musk's increased focus on his companies rather than political engagements. The company is also transitioning into an AI and robotics business, further expanding its market potential and reflecting Musk's broad influence across multiple cutting-edge industries and solidifying his status as a titan of innovation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration froze approximately $18 billion in federal funding for New York City infrastructure projects, including the Hudson Tunnel and Second Avenue Subway, on the first day of a government shutdown. The White House cited a review for "unconstitutional DEI principles" as the reason, directly targeting the home state of Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries. This move, framed by the administration as a response to the shutdown, sparked strong criticism from Schumer and Jeffries, who called the projects "lifelines" for jobs and the economy. They accused Trump of political retaliation, highlighting the potential negative impact on working families and America's competitiveness, intensifying the political standoff.</p>

          <p>Leo Garcia Venegas, a US citizen and construction worker in Alabama, has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging he was detained twice by immigration agents in workplace raids. The lawsuit, supported by the Institute for Justice, demands an end to what it calls "unconstitutional and illegal immigration enforcement tactics," including racial profiling. Venegas claims agents targeted Latino-looking workers and dismissed his valid Real ID driver’s license as fake. The Department of Homeland Security denied racial targeting, stating arrests are based on "reasonable suspicion" of illegal presence, not ethnicity, but did not explain Venegas's repeated detentions despite his citizenship, raising concerns about civil liberties.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has launched a "war against drug cartels," extending resources and military support to Ecuador, a key transit country for narcotics. This article highlights an Ecuadorian police raid in Guayaquil, demonstrating increased efforts to combat criminal networks in cooperation with the US. Ecuador welcomes the US assistance, which includes money, guns, and technology, with plans for a US military base. The strategy aims to disrupt drug chains by targeting lower-level dealers to gather intelligence on higher-ups, reflecting a concerted international effort to curb drug trafficking and enhance regional security, although the raids themselves are depicted as chaotic and upsetting for families.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order designating any armed attack against Qatar as a threat to US peace and security, pledging diplomatic, economic, and potentially military measures to defend Qatari interests. This move came after Israel bombed Qatar's capital, Doha, targeting Hamas leaders, prompting an apology from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for violating Qatari sovereignty. Qatar hosts the largest US military base in the Middle East, and this order aims to reinforce the security relationship, which had been strained by the Israeli strike and subsequent threats from Netanyahu.

          <p>The federal government initiated a shutdown after lawmakers failed to agree on extending funding, primarily due to a stalemate between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare tax credits. Democrats insisted on including these subsidies in any funding measure, while Republicans pushed for a "clean" temporary extension without such negotiations. This impasse resulted in hundreds of thousands of federal workers facing furloughs and unpaid leave, with essential employees working without pay. The article explains the annual funding process and the economic and political costs of such a lapse, highlighting the deep divisions in Washington and the ongoing struggle to pass full-year spending bills, with both sides trading blame for the gridlock.</p>

          <p>This article debunks common myths about cooking oils, offering expert advice on their health benefits and best uses. Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge explains that oils like rapeseed and sunflower, often criticized, are "absolutely good for us" due to low saturated fat and high healthier fats, making them suitable for deep frying. Margarine, once maligned for trans fats, is now considered part of a healthy diet with modern versions containing close to zero trans fats. Extra virgin olive oil, with its low smoke point, is best for dressings, while basic olive oil is fine for shallow frying. The article emphasizes choosing oils based on their fat content and smoke point for optimal health and cooking, rather than relying on outdated beliefs.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has significantly escalated drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, leading to fuel shortages and price increases in parts of Russia. An analysis by BBC Verify and BBC Russian found 21 of 38 large refineries hit since January, with strikes soaring in August and September. President Zelensky views these attacks as a key strategy to pressure Russia into negotiations. The campaign, targeting both civilian supply and military logistics facilities, has forced some refineries to suspend operations and caused retail petrol prices to surge by 40% since January, increasing the economic strain on Russia and disrupting daily life for some citizens, although crude oil exports remain largely unaffected.</p>

          <p>Nadine Fallone was awarded nearly £65,000 by an employment tribunal for unfair treatment and dismissal but has not received a penny over a year later, even after using a government scheme. This article reveals that over 5,000 out of 7,000 claimants using the scheme have not received their payments, and despite thousands of penalties issued, only 109 were recorded as paid. The system, designed to tackle non-payments, is criticized as "completely broken" by Citizens Advice, leading to financial hardship and emotional distress for claimants. This highlights a significant failure in the UK's justice system, leaving many successful claimants financially vulnerable and disillusioned, calling for an overhaul.</p>

This follows similar settlements by Meta and X, totaling $59.5 million, interpreted as tech giants "bowing" to Trump and signaling a broader shift in content moderation policies. The article argues these settlements are acts of corporate cowardice, suggesting platforms are abandoning difficult editorial decisions and reinforcing their "neutral platform" claims to avoid liability. This trend implies a move towards looser content rules, even for election denial and misinformation, raising concerns about the spread of false beliefs and the platforms' responsibility.</p>
