          <p>The U.S. stock market enjoyed a strong week, marked by the S&P 500's impressive nine-day winning streak, fueled by positive labor data and quarterly earnings from tech giants like Apple and Amazon. Despite some investor concerns over Apple's services revenue and Amazon's forward guidance, Microsoft and Meta Platforms emerged as top performers, driven by robust earnings reports. Eli Lilly faced a decline due to a competitor's partnership, while the market overall digested the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs. Investors are now looking ahead to upcoming earnings reports from companies like Ford and Disney, as well as insights from the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year includes $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, targeting the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. While aiming for "significant savings," the proposal also seeks a 13% increase in defense spending, reaching $1.01 trillion. The budget allocates $175 billion for the southern border and $134 million for trade enforcement, drawing criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. Republican senators like Roger Wicker and Susan Collins expressed concerns over defense funding and program cuts, while Democrats like Patty Murray criticized the defunding of programs benefiting working Americans.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are considering incorporating President Trump's campaign promises of tax cuts into upcoming legislation, including exemptions for tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits. However, concerns over the cost of these proposals, which could amount to trillions of dollars, are forcing Republicans to consider spending cuts to Medicaid and other programs. While some Republicans express reservations about the lack of a guiding principle behind these tax cuts, others are working to limit their scope and duration to mitigate the impact on the deficit. The leading proposal for not taxing tips, for instance, includes income thresholds and industry restrictions to prevent widespread tax avoidance.</p>

          <p>Netflix's stock has surged to all-time highs, marking an 11-day winning streak fueled by strong first-quarter revenue growth driven by subscriptions and advertising dollars.

While traditional media stocks have struggled, Netflix has thrived, forecasting full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion. Despite subscription price hikes, Netflix appears to have maintained its value proposition, although the company has stopped sharing details on membership numbers.</p>

          <p>Allergy sufferers are experiencing worsened symptoms this year due to warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns, which cause plants to release pollen earlier and for longer periods. May is typically the peak pollen season, with high levels of both tree and grass pollens. Climate change is contributing to this increase, with warmer temperatures causing plants to bloom earlier and produce more pollen. Experts recommend limiting exposure by keeping windows closed, showering at night, and using over-the-counter medications, while also suggesting consulting a physician for prescription options or immunotherapy if symptoms persist.</p>

          <p>With many borrowers facing financial strain, debt forgiveness is gaining attention as a potential relief strategy, offering the possibility of paying less than the total balance owed. However, it's essential to consider key questions before pursuing this option, including whether you meet the requirements, have explored other debt relief options, and need expert help with negotiations. Debt forgiveness typically requires being significantly behind on payments and demonstrating financial hardship, and it works best with unsecured debts. Other options like debt management plans or debt consolidation may be more suitable depending on individual circumstances.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed resilience in April, adding 177,000 jobs with an unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2 percent, despite the onset of a global trade war. While these figures are based on surveys taken just after the Trump administration's tariff implementations, the full impact on the labor market is expected to unfold in the coming months. Analysts are closely watching consumer sentiment and business plans, as tariffs could lead to higher prices and potential economic strain for households.

          <p>With the average homeowner possessing a substantial amount of home equity, understanding the most cost-effective ways to access it is crucial. Currently, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) offers the lowest interest rates compared to home equity loans and cash-out refinancing. While HELOCs have variable interest rates, they are expected to remain affordable, especially with potential interest rate cuts later in the year. Reverse mortgages offer an alternative with no monthly repayments, but are typically reserved for homeowners aged 62 and older. Borrowers should carefully consider repayment scenarios to ensure long-term affordability.</p>

          <p>Google plans to launch its Gemini artificial intelligence chatbot for children under 13 with parent-managed Google accounts, prompting concerns about child safety. While Google has implemented guardrails to filter inappropriate content and prevent data training, child advocacy groups warn that the chatbots could confuse, misinform, and manipulate young children. Google acknowledges potential risks and advises parents to teach their children critical thinking and fact-checking skills when using Gemini, alerting them that the chatbot can make mistakes and may encounter unwanted content.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is intensifying its efforts to break up Google's advertising technology empire, requesting the divestiture of tools used by online publishers to sell ad space and the technology connecting them with advertisers. This move follows a ruling that Google holds a monopoly over certain parts of the ad system. Google argues that a breakup would threaten privacy and security, while the Justice Department contends it is necessary to protect competition. The case is the latest legal challenge to Google, which is also facing scrutiny over its monopoly in search.</p>

The new system uses AI-powered cameras to capture images of items in carts, matching them with purchases made through a mobile app. While Sam's Club claims it is not using AI to upsell customers, consumer advocates worry that personalized promotions could lead to higher-priced products being promoted to certain shoppers based on their habits.

The researchers, based at the University of Zurich, aimed to study whether AI-generated responses could change people's views. The experiment involved posting over 1,000 AI-generated comments on various topics, with the AI commenters even sharing personalized backstories. The researchers' approach has been widely criticized as unethical, raising concerns about the integrity of online research and the potential for AI to manipulate human beliefs.</p>

          <p>U.S. employers added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing analyst forecasts and indicating a robust labor market despite ongoing economic uncertainties related to the Trump administration's trade policies. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, and while health care and transportation/warehousing sectors saw the largest gains, federal employment declined. Experts suggest that the economy has proven resilient, though the long-term impact of tariffs and government cuts remains a concern. The strong job gains also increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rate policy.</p>
