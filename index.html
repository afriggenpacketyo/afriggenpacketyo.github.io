          <p>Harvard University and the Trump administration are facing off in federal court over more than $2 billion in frozen government grants. The White House suspended the funding, demanding that Harvard alter its policies on admissions, hiring, and diversity programs to combat alleged antisemitism. Harvard argues the administration's actions are an unconstitutional infringement on free speech and violate procedural rules for suspending federal funds. The case is being closely watched for its potential impact on federal oversight of higher education.</p>

          <p>A Belgian environmental project is using a 1906 shipwreck on the North Sea floor as a sanctuary to reintroduce rare flat oysters, a species decimated by overfishing and disease. Researchers deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, hoping to establish a new reef that will purify water and support broader marine biodiversity. The wreck was chosen because it is a protected heritage site where disruptive activities like fishing are banned. This innovative approach aims to restore a crucial component of the marine ecosystem.</p>

          <p>All residents of the Beech Rise and Willow Rise apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are being evicted after the buildings were deemed unsafe by the fire service. Despite residents and the local council spending approximately £1 million on safety patrols and attempted repairs, the problems remain unresolved. Leaseholders describe years of frustration with rising service charges and deteriorating conditions under a series of management companies, highlighting what a local official calls a "broken leasehold system." The situation leaves 160 households facing homelessness.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is now displaying “Realms of the Dharma: Buddhist Art Across Asia,” a major exhibition of masterworks from its permanent collection. Many of these splendid sculptures and paintings have been unavailable to the public for nearly eight years, having been in storage or on tour during the demolition and reconstruction of the museum's main campus. The exhibition provides a long-awaited opportunity for visitors to see the varied and profound artistic traditions of Buddhism from across the continent.</p>

          <p>A volunteer-run nonprofit, Dog Coalition Los Angeles, is providing an innovative solution to the city's animal shelter overpopulation crisis. The organization supports people who foster large shelter dogs—the demographic most at risk of euthanasia—by offering training, guidance, and a strong community network. This approach not only helps save the lives of individual dogs by improving their chances of adoption but also builds lasting friendships among the human participants, creating a positive support system for both pets and people.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of deadly floods in Texas, a California-based weather modification company called Rainmaker became the subject of widespread conspiracy theories that falsely blamed its cloud-seeding activities for the disaster. Despite numerous scientists debunking the claims as physically impossible, the allegations were amplified by prominent political figures and have fueled a push to ban weather modification technologies. The incident illustrates how misinformation can rapidly spread and complicate public discourse on scientific and environmental management, even after a tragedy.</p>
