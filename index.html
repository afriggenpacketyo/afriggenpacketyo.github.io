          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump unlawfully imposed certain country-based tariffs, potentially entitling American businesses to tens of billions of dollars in refunds. The Trump administration has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, creating uncertainty for companies struggling with pricing and supply chain disruptions. If the ruling is upheld, the government would need to establish a process for refunding the collected levies, which could be automatic or require businesses to apply, similar to past precedents.

          <p>Danish renewable energy company Orsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following an abrupt order to halt construction on its nearly complete Revolution Wind farm. The project, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, was 80% finished and poised to power over 350,000 homes. Orsted claims the stop-work order, justified by the administration on national security grounds, is a pretext for President Trump's well-known hostility towards wind power and puts a $5 billion investment at risk.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration has expressed strong disapproval of Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund's decision to divest from American manufacturer Caterpillar. The fund, the world's largest, cited risks related to the use of the company's equipment in the Gaza conflict as the reason for its exit. A State Department spokesperson called the decision "very troubled" and based on "illegitimate claims," confirming that the U.S. is directly engaging with the Norwegian government on the matter, which has also drawn criticism from Republican senators.</p>

A prosecutor argued that Burkhardt is the "worst kind of offender" who consistently seeks to circumvent release conditions, citing his recent arrest for secretly using social media. Burkhardt has been in and out of prison since 1987 for crimes including molesting his niece, and his potential release has caused significant fear in his community.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that the UK government is considering the implementation of a digital ID system as a tool to tackle illegal immigration. Starmer suggested such a program could play an "important part" in making it more difficult for individuals to work in the country without permission, noting that public perception of digital identity has evolved since the controversial physical ID card debate two decades ago. The proposal aims to create a more consistent method for employers to verify a person's right to work.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic are preparing for their next major encounter in the US Open semifinals, continuing one of tennis's most compelling rivalries despite a 16-year age gap.

          <p>Newly released court documents detail the items seized by the FBI during a raid on the home of John Bolton, Donald Trump's former national security adviser. The inventory includes iPhones, USB drives, a computer, and binders of documents, which were taken as part of an investigation into the handling of classified materials. The search warrant was based on "evidence of a crime," and while Bolton has not been charged, the raid is seen by some as a reflection of the Trump administration's aggressive posture towards its critics.</p>

          <p>In one of his first major directives, new Paramount CEO David Ellison has mandated a full five-day-a-week return to the office for employees, starting in January. To facilitate the transition, the company is offering a severance package to lower-ranking employees in Los Angeles and New York who choose to leave rather than comply. The move is part of Ellison's strategy to reset the company's culture and is seen as a precursor to significant staff cuts as the new leadership aims for over $2 billion in cost savings.</p>

          <p>An analysis of recent mass shootings suggests perpetrators are increasingly performing for an online subculture that glorifies their acts. In these morbid communities, killers are treated as "saints," and their manifestos, livestreams, and even markings on their weapons serve to inspire future attackers and entrench them in a legacy of violence. This dynamic confounds traditional efforts to find a coherent political motive, as the primary goal appears to be achieving notoriety within this nihilistic, self-reinforcing network of terror.</p>
