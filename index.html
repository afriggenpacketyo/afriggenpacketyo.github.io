        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that family offices are intensifying their competition for skilled executives by implementing more structured and generous long-term incentive plans. These plans, now used by nearly two-thirds of investment-focused family offices, are boosting total compensation based on performance and investment returns. Median pay for CEOs at these firms has reached $825,000, with top executives at larger offices earning over $3 million annually. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities and carried interest, reflecting a shift from informal agreements to formalized, performance-driven compensation structures.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, despite a significant drop in profits compared to the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's net income fell by 44% to $2.49 billion, but adjusted earnings per share beat estimates. Chevron anticipates its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation will start contributing to earnings by the fourth quarter and aims to cut annual costs by $1 billion by the end of 2025. Record second-quarter production output helped mitigate the financial impact of the decline in oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling well short of expectations and marking a significant slowdown. Compounding the weak report, job gains for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating the labor market was much weaker than previously thought. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.2%, with concerning rises in long-term unemployment and a drop in the labor force participation rate. Analysts suggest this cooling trend reflects firms holding off on hiring due to new cost structures from escalating trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, visited a controversial Israeli-backed aid distribution site in Gaza, accompanied by the U.S. ambassador to Israel and the IDF. The visit to a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site follows numerous reports of deadly shootings in their vicinity, with the UN reporting hundreds of Palestinian casualties. While officials praised the GHF's efforts, some Gazans criticized the visit as a media stunt that fails to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis. The visit highlights the deep divisions and tensions surrounding aid distribution in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>A persistent malvertising campaign on Facebook is using deceptive ads that mimic well-known cryptocurrency platforms like Binance and feature celebrity faces to trick users. According to Bitdefender Labs, clicking these ads leads to convincing fake websites that prompt users to download a supposed desktop client, which is actually a sophisticated malware installer. This malware establishes a silent server on the victim's device to receive malicious instructions, bypassing many traditional security measures. The campaign highlights significant vulnerabilities in Facebook's ad moderation, allowing scammers to target users based on their interests in finance and technology.</p>

Qatar argues the rules are overly burdensome and conflict with its national energy strategy, which positions LNG as a transition fuel.

The duties range from a baseline of 10% to as high as 41% for some nations, formalizing a key part of the administration's protectionist trade agenda. Duties on Canadian goods will increase from 25% to 35%, while Mexico has received a 90-day extension. The move separates trading partners into tiers based on whether the U.S. runs a trade surplus or deficit with them, aiming to rewrite international commerce rules that the administration has long argued are unfair.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his public attacks on the Federal Reserve and its Chair, Jerome Powell, after the central bank decided to hold interest rates steady. In a series of posts on his social media platform, Trump called Powell a 'stubborn MORON' and demanded an immediate and substantial rate cut. He suggested the Federal Reserve Board should 'assume control' if Powell refuses to act, highlighting dissenting opinions within the board. The president's aggressive criticism of the independent central bank continues to challenge longstanding political norms regarding monetary policy.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for Storm Floris, the sixth named storm of the season, which is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain across the country on Monday. The Met Office has issued forecasts predicting wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph in northern coastal and hilly areas, with some exposed parts of Scotland potentially seeing gusts up to 85 mph. Inland areas are likely to experience gusts of 40-50 mph. The storm poses a risk of travel disruptions, power outages, and potential damage to temporary structures, as trees in full leaf are more vulnerable to being toppled.</p>

          <p>At the urging of Donald Trump, Texas Republicans have unveiled a new congressional map designed to secure five additional seats for the party. The proposed redistricting achieves this by altering boundaries in South Texas and the Dallas and Houston metro areas, packing Democratic voters into fewer districts and creating new, heavily Republican ones. Critics and voting rights groups argue the map is an extreme gerrymander that illegally diminishes the influence of Hispanic and Black voters, who drove 95% of the state's recent population growth. The plan is being introduced amid an ongoing legal battle over the state's current, already-contested district map.</p>

          <p>Beijing has strongly criticized the Trump administration's latest round of widespread tariffs, reaffirming its stance that 'there are no winners in tariff or trade wars.' A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the arbitrary imposition of tariffs is a form of protectionism that will ultimately harm everyone involved. The new U.S. duties target 69 trading partners with rates from 10% to 41%. Most Asian economies will face levies between 15% and 20%, a significant increase in trade barriers that introduces further uncertainty into the global economic landscape.</p>

The project will initially focus on applications such as airborne surveillance and contested logistics, with testing set to begin this fall and operational demonstrations planned for 2026.

          <p>Two Federal Reserve governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, have publicly explained their dissenting votes against the decision to hold interest rates steady. Both officials argued for a quarter-point rate reduction, stating that the central bank's 'wait and see' approach is overly cautious and risks harming the labor market and economic growth. They believe the inflationary impact of tariffs is likely temporary and should be looked through, asserting that a delay in easing policy could cause the Fed to fall behind the curve. Their statements represent a rare public disagreement among the Fed's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. is a critical market, accounting for a sixth of Swiss exports, and business groups have warned the tariff could put tens of thousands of jobs at risk. While there is a possibility for last-minute negotiations before the August 7 effective date, the news has already caused a negative market reaction.</p>

They argue that halving the department's staff will create a self-fulfilling prophecy of government inefficiency.

The SAVE plan was blocked by legal challenges and ultimately repealed by Congress, with the Trump administration stating the Education Department lacked the authority for a zero-percent interest status.

          <p>A contributor for the Los Angeles Times argues that the new sequel, 'Happy Gilmore 2,' continues the original film's underlying conservative message about the primacy of family. The article posits that protagonist Happy Gilmore's motivations in both films are purely altruistic, playing golf not for personal glory but to provide for his grandmother and, in the sequel, his daughter. The author suggests that Adam Sandler, who casts his own wife and daughter in the new film, is conveying a traditional message that a meaningful life is one of service to family. This contrasts with the character's rebellious, foul-mouthed persona.</p>
