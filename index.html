          <p>Following deadly missile and drone attacks on Kyiv, President Trump criticized Vladimir Putin and urged him to "STOP!" emphasizing the need for a peace deal amidst significant casualties. Trump's message came a day after he expressed his belief that Russia was ready for a peace agreement with Ukraine, highlighting the urgency to end the conflict. Trump stated he was not happy with the Russian strikes, deeming them unnecessary and poorly timed, as he continues to push for a resolution to the war. Trump's focus remains on achieving a peace deal, citing the high number of soldier deaths as a catalyst for immediate action. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>Russia has returned the body of Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna, who disappeared in occupied east Ukraine in August 2023 and died in Russian custody. Roshchyna's body was returned as part of an exchange at the end of February, but officials waited to confirm her identity due to the condition of the body, which showed signs of torture. A joint investigation revealed she was arrested in Energodar, held in Melitopol, and transferred to a jail in Taganrog, where she reportedly stopped eating and had knife wounds.

          <p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama addressed her decision to skip President Trump's inauguration, emphasizing her focus on making choices that are right for herself. She shared that she has been working on feeling comfortable saying "no," with the help of therapy, and setting an example for her daughters. Obama hopes to teach them to practice saying "no" earlier in life to build that skill, as it is important to prioritize one's own needs and well-being. She also discussed the challenges of being a shock absorber for others and the importance of living for oneself. Optimism score: 85</p>
