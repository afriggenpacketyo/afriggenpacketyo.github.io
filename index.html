          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven leaders' meeting in Canada, focusing on resolving trade tariff issues. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, will visit Washington for negotiations to bridge the gap over Trump's tariff policy, with Japan seeking the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. While Japan initially demanded the complete elimination of these duties, they are now considering accepting reduced tariff rates as negotiations continue. Both countries aim to reach a deal swiftly, emphasizing the importance of boosting investment and creating jobs in the United States. The U.S. seeks to reduce its trade deficit with Japan.</p>

          <p>A recall of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded to Class II by the FDA due to mislabeling, posing a health risk to consumers. The affected cans, distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, were labeled as "zero sugar" but contained the full sugar content of regular Dr Pepper, approximately 39 grams. This mislabeling can cause issues for individuals who need to avoid sugar, especially those with diabetes, potentially leading to hyperglycemia and related complications. Customers who purchased the recalled cans, bearing the product code XXXXRS05165 and a ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date of February 16, 2026, are advised to return them for a full refund or discard them.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting legal loopholes in Europe to smuggle ketamine, swapping it for substances like salt and sugar during transit. This practice takes advantage of ketamine's classification as a legal medicine in some countries, allowing for easier transportation across borders. Belgian investigators have uncovered numerous cases of consignment switches involving large quantities of ketamine, leading to its illegal sale as a hallucinogenic drug. The rise in ketamine consumption has been linked to deaths and health issues, including cognitive problems and bladder damage. Law enforcement agencies are challenged by ketamine's dual classification as both a vital anaesthetic and a recreational drug.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to address elevated rice prices through direct contracts with retailers. This release will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. The move aims to alleviate distribution shortages and combat suspected hoarding by wholesalers and farmers. This initiative follows previous releases and marks the first time reserves are being discharged to alleviate distribution shortages, reflecting the government's effort to stabilize prices amid public frustration.</p>

The yacht, carrying 12 people attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, was intercepted by Israeli forces and towed to Ashdod. Israel has dismissed the vessel as a "selfie yacht," stating that the passengers are being deported back to their home countries. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), which operated the vessel, said the activists were being processed and transferred into Israeli custody. The boat aimed to bring a symbolic amount of aid to Gaza in defiance of the Israeli naval blockade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an unprecedented decline in world fertility rates, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as key factors. The report, based on a survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries, reveals that one in five respondents are unable to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents, with only 12% attributing their situation to infertility. The UNFPA emphasizes that many people feel unable to create the families they want, identifying this as a real crisis.</p>

          <p>Gregory Hunt is scheduled to be executed in Alabama for the 1988 murder of Karen Lane, marking the state's sixth execution using nitrogen gas. Hunt was convicted of beating Lane to death after a month-long relationship, with prosecutors alleging sexual assault. Hunt's final appeal focused on claims of false statements made by prosecutors regarding evidence of sexual assault. While not disputing the killing, Hunt maintains he did not sexually assault Lane and describes himself as transformed by his time in prison, where he leads a Bible class.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a significant decline, particularly in the Gen Z demographic, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk. Data from the CDC indicates that fentanyl and other drugs killed over 31,000 people under 35 in 2021, but this number dropped to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Factors contributing to this shift include wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a trend of less risky drug use among teens. Despite this progress, challenges remain, especially for those struggling with severe addiction and potential funding cuts for addiction services.</p>

          <p>California's state Democrats have elected Sen. Monique Lim√≥n as the next Senate president pro tem, making her the first woman of color to hold the position. Lim√≥n, currently chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus and the Senate banking committee, will take over in early 2026. She emphasized the significance of her election amidst ICE raids targeting minorities in Los Angeles and across the state. Lim√≥n has been vocal on issues such as the Sable Offshore Pipeline project, advocating for community input and safety guidelines.</p>
