            <p>Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse was refused entry to Hong Kong, sparking outrage and diplomatic concern. Hobhouse, a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, was traveling to visit her newborn grandson but was detained at the airport and deported without explanation. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has urged the Foreign Secretary to summon the Chinese Ambassador, calling the incident a concerning attempt to undermine British democracy. This event raises questions about the UK's engagement with China, especially considering Beijing's previous sanctions on critical MPs.</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey, targeted by President Trump with an executive order, has filed a lawsuit alleging abuse of power. The firm, known for representing Dominion Voting Systems and securing a significant settlement from Fox News, claims Trump is retaliating against them for defending the integrity of the 2020 election. The executive order seeks to block the firm's access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. Susman Godfrey argues the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies.</p>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing confusion and anxiety among consumers and businesses. Initial plans for widespread tariffs sparked panic buying, while subsequent exemptions have created a sense of paralysis. The constant changes make it difficult for businesses to plan and for consumers to anticipate price increases. Some economists predict that the tariffs could lead to higher prices and slower economic growth, while others believe that the impact will be temporary. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from tariffs, including the 125% levies imposed on Chinese imports. This move is seen as a significant relief for tech companies, as it avoids potential price increases on gadgets. The White House stated that the exemptions were made to give companies more time to move production to the US. The decision comes after Trump announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs, except for China.</p>

            <p>Golfer Jordan Spieth hinted at potential censorship by Masters organizers regarding the issue of mud balls affecting play at Augusta National. Spieth expressed frustration with mud impacting his iron play, particularly on certain holes, but noted a reluctance to discuss the topic openly. He suggested that the presence of mud balls can significantly alter strategy and scoring, and that the inability to address it is frustrating. Spieth is not the first golfer to raise concerns about this issue at the Masters.</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel, owned by Jingye, using emergency legislation passed in Parliament. This action was prompted by concerns that Jingye would shut down the plant's blast furnaces, ending primary steel production in the UK. The government's next step is likely to be nationalizing the Scunthorpe plant, which employs thousands. The move aims to protect jobs and ensure the future of the steel industry in Britain, with the government hoping to secure private investment in the long term.</p>

The probation department has restricted visitation as part of its investigation into the source of the drugs. Concerns about drug prevalence in L.A.
