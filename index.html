        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's budget package moved forward in the House after negotiations addressed concerns from conservative Republicans who initially stalled the bill, feeling it did not contain steep enough spending cuts. Four conservative representatives voted 'present' instead of against the legislation, allowing it to advance to a floor vote before the Memorial Day deadline. House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated that minor modifications would be made to the legislation. The bill aims to enact Trump's policies on tax cuts, immigration, energy, defense, and raising the debt limit through budget reconciliation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden's recent diagnosis of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones is considered serious, but advancements in treatment and diagnosis have dramatically improved survival rates for men with advanced prostate cancer. Experts say that life expectancy is now measured in years rather than months due to research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Department. Treatment typically involves cutting off testosterone, the hormone that feeds prostate cancer, using drugs and potentially chemotherapy or radiation. Improved diagnostic tools, like the PSMA PET scan, allow doctors to spot the cancer earlier, leading to better prognoses. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, prompting discussions about the disease's symptoms, treatments, and prognosis. Biden's cancer has a Gleason score of 9, indicating a more aggressive form that has spread to his bones. The former president's office said the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which means it should respond to testosterone-blocking treatment. While prostate cancer is often curable if detected early, the goal in Biden's case is to control the disease, slow progression, and preserve quality of life. </p>
