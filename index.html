        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's proposed tariffs would reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. However, the CBO also projects that these tariffs would negatively impact the U.S. economy, reducing gross domestic product growth by 0.06% annually. The tariffs are expected to increase inflation by an average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026, diminishing the purchasing power of households and businesses. The analysis accounts for retaliatory tariffs from other countries and the uncertainty stemming from recent changes in trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasing pressure on Columbia University by questioning its accreditation due to alleged failures in addressing antisemitism on campus. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights has notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), Columbia's accrediting body, that the university may not be meeting accreditation standards. This action follows the administration's earlier decision to cancel $400 million in federal grants to Columbia over concerns about the protection of Jewish students.

          <p>The Trump administration's increase in tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% has taken effect, potentially raising costs for consumers on a wide range of products. Experts say the levies will raise the cost of manufacturing on items like cars, sports equipment, canned goods, and household appliances. Businesses typically pass on most or all tariff-related costs to consumers through higher prices. The tariffs are intended to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations, but may lead to inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
