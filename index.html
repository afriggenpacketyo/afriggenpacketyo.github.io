        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high of $3,508.50 per ounce, marking a nearly one-third increase this year as investors seek safer assets. This trend is driven by global economic uncertainty, exacerbated by U.S. trade policies and expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Analysts also point to concerns over the independence of the U.S. central bank as a significant factor fueling demand for the precious metal, even in major jewelry markets like China and India.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are highlighting a provision in President Trump's new tax legislation that could expand eligibility for the 0% long-term capital gains tax bracket. For 2025, single filers with taxable income up to $48,350 and married couples up to $96,700 could qualify, allowing for "tax-gain harvesting" by selling profitable assets without tax liability. This creates an opportunity for investors to rebalance portfolios or reset their cost basis on investments, though the strategy's suitability depends on an individual's broader financial plan.

          <p>A 42-year-old Houston man, Leon Gonzalo Jr., has been charged with murder for the fatal shooting of an 11-year-old boy. The incident occurred after the boy and his friends engaged in a "ding-dong-ditch" style prank, part of a social media trend, at the suspect's home. According to police, the suspect chased the children down the street while firing a weapon, striking the victim who later died at a hospital. This tragedy is one of several recent violent incidents linked to this online challenge.</p>

          <p>Shares of Constellation Brands, the maker of Modelo and Corona beer, fell approximately 6% after the company significantly lowered its fiscal year outlook. The beverage giant cited a challenging macroeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand, particularly noting a decline in purchasing from Hispanic consumers. The company now anticipates a 4% to 6% drop in organic net sales and a 2% to 4% decline in beer sales, attributing the slowdown to reduced trip frequency and spending per trip.

          <p>A recent Wall Street Journal-NORC poll indicates a significant decline in Americans' belief in the "American dream," with only 31% of adults surveyed stating that hard work still leads to success.

The survey also found widespread concern over food prices and a record low of 25% of respondents who feel they have a good chance of improving their standard of living, reflecting deep economic anxieties.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. The ruling blocks the administration from using these forces for civilian law enforcement activities like arrests and crowd control within California. Judge Charles Breyer's decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the state and warned that such deployments could create "a national police force with the President as its chief."</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased as a federal court ruling deemed most of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal, creating the possibility that the government may have to refund billions in collected revenue. This prospect has raised concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation, potentially requiring a surge in Treasury issuance to cover the shortfall. The 30-year bond yield surpassed 4.97%, its highest since late July, reflecting market anxiety over the financial implications of the court's decision and its potential impact on the national deficit.

          <p>While Russia's Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corporation have signed a memorandum for the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, analysts suggest key obstacles remain. The project, which would transit through Mongolia and supply 50 billion cubic metres of gas to China annually, is a crucial economic priority for Moscow amid Western sanctions. Despite a public commitment to "big project cooperation" from both nations during a recent summit, unresolved issues, likely related to pricing and financing, could still delay the pipeline's final approval and construction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has stayed the scheduled execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate, ruling that his competency must be reevaluated due to worsening dementia. Menzies was sentenced for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker and had chosen to be executed by firing squad. His attorneys argued that his cognitive decline is so severe that he can no longer understand why he is facing execution, a standard protected under the U.S. Constitution's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The decision puts his execution on hold pending a new competency hearing.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a powerful magnitude 6 earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has risen to over 1,400, with more than 3,100 people injured.

Aid workers on the ground describe a desperate situation with shortages of food and medical supplies, stating that helicopter support is essential to reach trapped survivors.

First elected in 1992, Nadler is a prominent figure who chaired the House Judiciary Committee and served as an impeachment manager during President Trump's first impeachment.

          <p>Scotland recorded 1,017 fatal drug overdoses in the last year, a 13% decrease and the lowest total since 2017, according to new figures. Despite this reduction, the country's drug death rate remains the highest in Europe and is significantly higher than in other UK nations. Opioids like heroin and methadone were implicated in 80% of the deaths, and deprivation remains a key factor, with people in the poorest areas being 12 times more likely to die from an overdose. Experts warn that the emergence of synthetic opioids like nitazenes poses a new threat.</p>

This extended naval activity has been described by Japanese media as having "almost completely circled" the country's archipelago, signaling an assertive military posture from Beijing in the region and prompting surveillance by Japan's Self-Defence Forces.</p>
