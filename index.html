          <p>A 72-year-old man, Mark Sanfratello, has been extradited to Oregon to face a second-degree murder charge for the 1983 death of his girlfriend, Teresa Peroni. The case was reopened in 2024, and investigators used modern forensic testing and new DNA evidence to identify a skull found in 1997 as Peroni's. The arrest highlights the role of advancing technology in solving cold cases, bringing a long-awaited development for the victim's family after decades of uncertainty. Authorities are still seeking information about the party where Peroni was last seen.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics fell sharply after the FDA indicated it may ask the company to halt shipments of its gene therapy drug, Elevidys, and is considering whether it should remain on the market. The investigation follows two patient deaths linked to the treatment, which is used for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and a third death in a trial for another of the company's therapies. The drug has a controversial history, having gained expanded approval despite failing to meet its primary goal in a key trial, raising significant safety concerns given its uncertain benefits.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of ether has surged, outperforming bitcoin, as Congress passed the GENIUS Act, a significant piece of stablecoin legislation now awaiting the president's signature. This bill is considered the first major crypto-focused law in the U.S., a development that has boosted investor confidence and led to record inflows for ether-based ETFs. Analysts note that momentum may be shifting from bitcoin to ether, which has seen its strongest two-week gain since 2021. The legislation is seen as a symbolic victory that could deeply embed stablecoins into the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study highlights a significant rise in accidental nicotine pouch ingestions by young children, with cases soaring 763% between 2020 and 2023. Researchers found that these pouches, which contain flavored nicotine powder, are more likely to cause serious medical outcomes compared to other nicotine products. The study analyzed calls to the National Poison Data System and noted the increase occurred even as ingestions of other nicotine forms, like liquids, declined. Experts are calling for greater prevention efforts, including banning flavors that attract children, and advise parents to keep all nicotine products out of reach.</p>

          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI personnel reviewing Jeffrey Epstein's case files were instructed to "flag" any records that mentioned President Donald Trump. In letters to the Justice Department and FBI, Durbin stated that this review involved around 1,000 personnel and was conducted under an arbitrarily short deadline. The senator's office received information suggesting the process was haphazard and involved staff who lacked expertise in handling such sensitive material. This claim adds to the political pressure on the administration regarding the transparency and handling of the Epstein investigation records.</p>

          <p>The European Union has adopted a new, stringent package of sanctions against Russia, targeting its energy, banking, and military sectors to curtail its ability to fund the war in Ukraine. Key measures include a lower price cap on Russian oil, a ban on future transactions via Nord Stream pipelines, and sanctions on more Russian banks and a "shadow fleet" of oil tankers. The package also restricts entities, including some in China and Turkey, from supplying Russia with dual-use technologies.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has mandated that former President Jair Bolsonaro must wear an ankle monitor and surrender his passport amid an ongoing investigation. This decision, which also prohibits him from using social media or contacting others under investigation, followed searches of his home and party headquarters. The measures are reportedly intended to prevent him from fleeing the country as he faces trial for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2022 election results.

          <p>The nation's 37 tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) are facing a potential 90% reduction in federal operations funding under a new budget proposal, threatening their ability to remain open.

The proposed cuts are causing deep concern among students and faculty, with some schools already canceling programs in anticipation.

This move, which will cost an additional $167,000 to carry out, has been condemned by critics as a waste of resources and an abdication of U.S. leadership in global health.

          <p>The legal case involving a Scottish nurse who complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor has intensified, with the nurse's lawyers condemning a public statement from NHS Fife as "irresponsible." The health board published a document online during the employment tribunal, alleging the proceedings had led to threats against its staff. The case centers on nurse Sandie Peggie's confrontation with Dr. Beth Upton in a female changing room, which led to the nurse's suspension. The tribunal has heard testimony that Dr. Upton was left shaken and distressed by the incident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is facing intense criticism and internal turmoil over its rollback of anti-discrimination provisions under the Trump administration. The agency has removed language from hospital bylaws that protected patients based on marital status and political views, and has also ended gender-affirming care for transgender veterans. VA Secretary Doug Collins has defended the moves as focusing on veterans over "woke causes," while critics and members of Congress express "profound alarm" that doctors could refuse treatment. The changes have created a chilling effect, with veterans and employees reporting fear and confusion over the new policies.</p>

His wife, Aviva Siegel, who was released earlier, also spoke, expressing support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported 38 cases of botulism poisoning in England over the past six weeks, believed to be linked to unlicensed Botox-like products used in cosmetic procedures. Botulism is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, and affected patients have experienced serious symptoms like difficulty swallowing and breathing. The evidence suggests that clinics involved were using unapproved products, prompting officials to urge the public to verify their practitioner's qualifications and ensure all products are licensed. The cases highlight the significant health risks associated with unregulated cosmetic treatments.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the airline industry shows that Delta and United are significantly outperforming their competitors, accounting for over 86% of the profits posted by the seven largest U.S. airlines last year.

While the industry as a whole faces pressure from falling domestic airfares and weaker demand, Delta and United's strategies have provided a buffer. Their CEOs have expressed confidence, pointing to the strength of their premium cabins and partnerships as key drivers of their continued success. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "no tax on tips" provision in President Trump's new legislation is causing confusion about how it works and who is eligible. The policy is not a complete tax elimination but rather a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000, which is still subject to payroll and state taxes. Crucially, the IRS has yet to clarify which specific occupations will qualify for the break, with guidance not expected until October. This uncertainty leaves many of the nation's roughly 4 million tipped workers unsure if they will benefit, especially as the law already excludes professions like actors and musicians.

It highlights Gibson's career, which began in spoken-word and evolved to a significant online presence, particularly on Instagram, where their work reached a broad audience. The piece praises Gibson's accessible and emotionally direct style, which centered on themes of love, queerness, and anxiety. It argues that by prioritizing a direct connection with the listener, Gibson's unashamedly sentimental and gentle verse resonated deeply with people who might not typically read poetry, creating a powerful and inclusive legacy.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that he and President Donald Trump support "maximum transparency" regarding the files on Jeffrey Epstein and want the American people to see the documents. Speaking after a report alleged a "bawdy" letter from Trump was in Epstein's possession, Johnson dismissed the claim as "patently absurd" and said the president is frustrated by it. In response to pressure, Trump has asked the Attorney General to release grand jury testimony, though such records are typically sealed. The comments highlight the complex political maneuvering by Republicans seeking to satisfy their base's suspicions without crossing the president.</p>

          <p>The UK government spent £2.1 billion on hotels for asylum seekers in the last fiscal year, a 30% decrease from the £3 billion spent the previous year, according to new Home Office figures. This saving was reportedly driven by moving asylum seekers into cheaper accommodations, such as shared housing, and increasing room sharing in the remaining hotels. However, experts warn that a recent surge in small boat crossings could increase the reliance on hotels again. The report also confirmed that £270 million paid to Rwanda for the now-scrapped deportation scheme will not be refunded.</p>

          <p>Following a significant 8.5% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock, analysts are defending the company, with Jefferies upgrading it to a "buy" rating. The sell-off was triggered by a slight cut in the company's growth outlook, which analysts and Abbott's CEO have called an "overreaction." They view the headwind from a slower-than-expected recovery in its diagnostics business in China as transitory and remain positive on the company's strong fundamentals. Analysts see the potential for accelerated growth in 2026, suggesting the market's punitive reaction was not justified by the minor guidance change. (not investment advice)</p>
