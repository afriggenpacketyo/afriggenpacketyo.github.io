          <p>The high-stakes summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, has concluded without a definitive ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine. While President Trump stated that "great progress" was made on many points, he acknowledged that no final deal was reached. Following the talks, Putin was invited to a future meeting in Moscow, an idea Trump suggested he might consider despite potential political criticism. Both leaders departed Alaska after the discussions, with Trump indicating he would soon speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO allies about the meeting's developments.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) designed as a condominium, allowing it to be sold independently from the main property. This development comes a year after the city pioneered legislation to enable such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. Mayor Matt Mahan expressed hope that this initiative will serve as a model for other cities in the state to address the ongoing housing crisis. Amid a statewide boom, ADUs accounted for approximately one-fifth of California's housing growth in 2024, with San José doubling its construction permits for these units over the last five years.</p>

          <p>A federal class-action lawsuit has been filed against the AI transcription service Otter.ai, accusing the company of secretly recording private conversations from virtual meetings without participants' consent. The suit, filed in California, alleges these recordings are used to train Otter's AI systems, violating federal and state privacy and wiretap laws. This legal action highlights growing concerns among users about the platform's default recording practices, especially its ability to join and record meetings automatically when linked to a user's calendar. The plaintiff claims this constitutes a severe invasion of privacy and seeks to represent others who were unknowingly recorded.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that the exposed, dusty shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, authorities have focused on dust-control projects around the sea to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory illness in the region. The study's authors suggest that since pollution originates from numerous sources like agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads, efforts might be more effective if shifted toward exposure control. This would involve improving indoor air quality with filters and weatherizing homes, rather than solely focusing on mitigating dust from the sea itself.</p>

During his trip, Khan met with Turkish-Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar, a move condemned by the Cypriot government. In his resignation letter, Khan stated he was stepping down to avoid distracting from the government's work, insisting the visit was made in a personal capacity during parliamentary recess and was unrelated to his official duties.</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes should avoid mangoes due to their sweetness. Two recent clinical trials suggest that consuming mangoes in moderation, particularly as a replacement for other carbohydrates like white bread, may actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. One study found that popular Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than bread, while another eight-week trial showed improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance among participants who ate mango for breakfast. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and that this finding is not a license for unlimited consumption.</p>

The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while each restaurant location features a Kobe mural, they wanted this one to fit the Dodgers theme, using an iconic, intense image of Bryant but altering the jersey.

The court found that Taylor had violated the prohibition against disclosing information from the final judgment.

The BBC spoke with several young individuals who detailed their struggles, with one student spending a large portion of her budget on daily commutes and another worker finding it difficult to save or move out of her family home.

The company's strategy focuses on manufacturing a simple, two-seat base model and allowing owners to customize it with over 100 planned accessories, including a kit to convert it into a five-seat SUV. By keeping the initial vehicle simple, Slate aims to reduce production costs and pass the savings to consumers. The approach has already attracted over 100,000 reservations, tapping into consumer demand for more affordable EV options amid rising prices and changing federal incentives.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached between the White House and Washington D.C. officials to limit the Trump administration's recent takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the new pact, control of the MPD will remain with its current chief, Pamela Smith, rather than being transferred to a federal administrator from the DEA. This development follows a lawsuit filed by the D.C. attorney general, who called the federal move a "hostile takeover" and argued it exceeded legal authority under the Home Rule Act. The agreement de-escalates a tense power struggle over local governance and policing in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to end the Trump administration's federalization of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). The resolution, invoking the D.C. Home Rule Act, argues that President Trump has not demonstrated the emergency conditions required by law to justify such a takeover. Lawmakers contend the move is an unlawful overreach and part of an attack on the district's autonomy, citing a misleading narrative about the city's crime rate, which has actually declined. This legislative action represents a formal challenge to the executive order and aims to restore full local control over the city's police force.</p>

The 2022 Scottish Album of the Year winner described the experience as surreal, which included Lee flying to Edinburgh to watch him perform live.

In a tense post-match interview following a cup win, Rodgers repeatedly stated he had no updates on potential signings, reflecting a frustration he has voiced in recent weeks. With the Champions League play-offs looming, the club has made a few additions but still appears short in key areas, particularly for a winger and a striker to replace departed players. The manager's public impatience highlights the pressure on the club to strengthen the squad before the window closes at the beginning of September.</p>

These legal challenges, including a suit from Louisiana's attorney general, argue that Roblox prioritizes profits over user safety.
