          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that a trade agreement with China is likely to be reached before reciprocal tariffs are scheduled to take effect in November. During an interview, Bessent noted that talks have become increasingly productive and that he believes the Chinese government now sees a deal as possible. This optimistic outlook comes amid ongoing negotiations to resolve trade imbalances, with the U.S. trade deficit with China on pace to decline significantly this year. The administration's goal is to achieve a more balanced and fair trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 16-year-old student responsible for a shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado had reportedly shared neo-Nazi and white supremacist content online prior to the attack. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the shooter, who took his own life after shooting two classmates, had shown interest in past mass shootings like Columbine and was active on forums discussing graphic violence. The FBI had been tipped off about his online activities in July, and law enforcement stated he was radicalized by an "extremist network." The incident has renewed concerns about online radicalization and its role in motivating violence.</p>

          <p>Technology firm Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium of companies involved in a framework deal that would allow TikTok to continue its operations in the United States. While the final structure is still unclear, the agreement aims to resolve national security concerns raised by the Trump administration regarding the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. This development builds on TikTok's existing partnership with Oracle, which routes U.S. user data through the American company's servers. The negotiations are a crucial step in avoiding a potential U.S. ban on the highly popular video-sharing platform.</p>

          <p>At the annual Zelman Housing Summit, industry leaders expressed significant concern over the lack of clarity regarding the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Willy Walker, CEO of Walker & Dunlop, emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's plans for privatizing the government-sponsored enterprises, which are critical for providing liquidity to the multifamily housing market. This ambiguity, along with broader industry challenges such as land entitlements and labor shortages, is creating apprehension among builders, lenders, and investors about the stability of the housing finance system.

          <p>This opinion article posits that the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk could push the Trump administration to focus more intensely on domestic issues like border security and culture wars. The author suggests that such an inward turn might lead to a more restrained and accommodative foreign policy, potentially easing tensions with China. This potential shift is viewed within the context of the administration's existing challenges, including the war in Ukraine and ongoing trade negotiations, where a less confrontational approach could become more appealing as domestic priorities take precedence.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1997, the United States has decertified Colombia as a partner in drug control efforts, citing the country's demonstrable failure to meet its obligations. The move comes as Colombia's cocaine production has surged to unprecedented levels under the leadership of President Gustavo Petro, whom President Trump personally criticized. Despite the formal rebuke, the White House issued a "national interest waiver," which prevents the imposition of sanctions and allows U.S. aid and security cooperation to continue, signaling Washington's desire to maintain its strategic alliance with Bogotá.</p>

          <p>A new study has identified what may be the oldest known mummies in the world, discovered across Southeast Asia and dating back up to 12,000 years. Researchers found that ancient hunter-gatherer communities intentionally preserved bodies by smoke-drying them over fires, a practice that predates the well-known Chinchorro mummies of South America by several millennia. This finding significantly pushes back the timeline of deliberate mummification and suggests the practice was a widespread tradition allowing ancient peoples to maintain connections with their deceased ancestors.</p>

          <p>As the Israeli military commences its ground assault on Gaza City, thousands of Palestinian families are desperately trying to flee the area. Civilians describe a harrowing evacuation process, with the single designated coastal road choked with traffic, causing 10-hour delays under the threat of ongoing airstrikes. The cost of transportation and temporary shelter has skyrocketed, forcing many to sell their possessions, leave everything behind, or attempt the perilous journey on foot. Residents remaining in the city have described the overnight bombardment as "insane" and "hell."</p>

          <h2>Progressive Groups Fear 'McCarthy Era' Crackdown Following Charlie Kirk's Killing</h2>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, progressive organizations are expressing alarm over calls from President Trump and his allies for government investigations into their work. Citing a letter from the House Freedom Caucus that demands a select committee to probe the "radical left's assault on America," these groups fear a politically motivated crackdown reminiscent of the McCarthy era. They argue that the administration is using Kirk's death as a pretext to create a climate of fear, silence dissent, and delegitimize organizations that oppose its agenda.</p>

          <p>Current and former employees of the U.S. Department of Labor under the Trump administration describe a hostile work environment where the agency's core mission to protect workers is being actively undermined. Staff report that drastic budget cuts, deregulation, and an atmosphere of fear have crippled the department's effectiveness, with one employee likening it to "working in a prison." Critics argue that policies, such as a proposal to eliminate wage protections for 3.7 million home care workers, demonstrate an administration that is systematically dismantling worker protections while claiming to put "American Workers FIRST."</p>

          <p>This article reflects on a 2022 interview with the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose off-the-record comments were approved for publication after his death. Kirk revealed that he viewed his primary goal not as achieving short-term political wins, but as fostering a long-term educational and cultural transformation among America's youth. He emphasized his passion for instilling Judeo-Christian values and creating a "cogent worldview" through his organization, Turning Point USA, seeing schools and churches as the most critical arenas for shaping the country's future for decades to come.</p>

          <p>Using the volatile aftermath of Charlie Kirk's killing as a backdrop, this article examines the historical and philosophical complexities of free speech. Through an interview with historian Fara Dabhoiwala, it argues that free speech is not a timeless, absolute right but a contested concept shaped by power, context, and the ability to amplify one's voice. The discussion traces the idea from its origins, where it was balanced against potential harms, to the modern American interpretation, which struggles to address the challenges of misinformation and online platforms in the digital age.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 06:51:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position, affirming a crucial aspect of the central bank's independence. Trump had announced his intention to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, citing allegations of mortgage fraud which she has denied. The 2-1 decision is a significant setback for the administration's efforts to exert political control over monetary policy and ensures Cook can participate in the upcoming Fed meeting, where an interest rate cut is widely anticipated.</p>
