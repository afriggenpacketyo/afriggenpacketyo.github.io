          <p>President Donald Trump said he will consult with Hollywood studios regarding his proposal to impose 100% tariffs on films made outside the United States. Trump stated he wants to help, not hurt, the industry and ensure they are happy with the proposal. This follows his earlier announcement authorizing the Commerce Department to begin instituting the tariffs, aimed at safeguarding national and economic security while "Making Hollywood Great Again."

          <p>Elon Musk is embroiled in a dispute with neighbors in West Lake Hills, Texas, over unpermitted construction at his mansion, including a 16-foot chain-link fence and an outward-facing camera. Neighbors have complained about the commotion, traffic, and security measures, leading to a contentious Zoning and Planning Commission meeting. The commission voted against granting variances for the projects, citing violations of city ordinances. Musk's team blamed a former house manager for the lack of permits, but neighbors remain skeptical, highlighting Musk's history of building first and seeking permission later.

          <p>Thousands of international students have had their immigration records terminated due to minor past encounters with law enforcement, causing chaos in their academic and professional lives. The Trump administration ran student names through the National Crime Information Center, flagging those with even dismissed charges or traffic offenses. Immigration lawyers argue that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) broke the law and didn't follow proper procedures, resulting in students losing their visa status and jobs. The Justice Department has since reversed course, but concerns remain about future policy changes that could make it easier to strip students of their legal status. Optimism score is 25.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is offering $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to undocumented immigrants who volunteer to return to their countries of origin, a policy they term "self-deportation." DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claims this is the safest, most cost-effective way to leave the U.S. to avoid arrest. The program, utilizing the CBP's "Home" app, requires immigrants to confirm their arrival in their home country to receive the stipend. DHS asserts this approach saves costs and allows resources to focus on criminals, potentially keeping the door open for legal immigration in the future. Optimism score is 45.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open reveals a link between state-level tax revenue and cancer outcomes.
