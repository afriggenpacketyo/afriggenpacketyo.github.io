        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett categorizes investments into three types: currency-denominated assets like bonds, non-productive assets such as gold, and productive assets like farms or businesses. He argues that non-productive assets rely solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them in the future, as they generate no intrinsic value. Buffett states his preference for productive assets, which are valued based on the output they can deliver over time, making them a more rational and dependable choice for long-term investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities across the globe, including New York, London, and Montreal, are experiencing a transformation by prioritizing cycling over car traffic, leading to cleaner and quieter urban environments. This shift is driven by the construction of protected bike lanes, safer intersections, and traffic signal adjustments that make cycling a viable option for people of all ages. The rise of e-bikes has further expanded accessibility, and the combined benefits include reduced carbon emissions, lower transportation costs for families, and improved public health, signaling a positive evolution in urban planning.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 08:18:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article asserts that the Supreme Court should affirm President Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. The author contends that the Fourteenth Amendment's phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" was never intended to apply to those in the country illegally, drawing parallels to historical rulings concerning Native Americans. The piece argues that the current interpretation incentivizes dangerous border crossings and that Trump's order is a necessary measure to reclaim national sovereignty and address the ongoing immigration crisis.</p>

          <p>A significant political divide has emerged within Generation Z, with young women identifying as leftist at a much higher rate than their male counterparts. This trend is attributed to their generation coming of age amidst crises like climate change, economic instability, and the erosion of reproductive rights, which disproportionately affect them. Many feel that the Democratic party is too centrist and that moderation is insufficient to address urgent threats, leading them to embrace anti-capitalist and more socially active political identities as a form of self-defense.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is expected to confirm Douglas Troutman, a former chemical industry lobbyist, to lead the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. His nomination has alarmed environmental and public health advocates, who point to his history of lobbying against chemical disclosure laws, such as California's Cleaning Product Right to Know Act. If confirmed, Troutman will be the fourth former industry lobbyist to hold a top position in the office, raising concerns that chemical safety regulations will be weakened in favor of corporate interests.</p>

          <p>Despite an escalating trade war involving tariffs and export restrictions, the economies of the United States and China remain deeply intertwined. The U.S. relies heavily on China for rare-earth minerals and consumer goods, while China depends on American aerospace and semiconductor technology. In response to U.S. tariffs, Beijing has retaliated with its own measures, such as boycotting American soybeans and restricting mineral exports.

While divorce rates have generally declined since the 1980s, the trend of remarriage reshapes family structures, with nearly half of remarried individuals having a child with their new spouse.</p>

          <h2>Native Tribes in Owens Valley Seek Return of Water Rights from Los Angeles</h2>

          <p>Native American tribes in California's Owens Valley are intensifying their fight to reclaim water rights from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP). For decades, the DWP has pumped significant amounts of groundwater from the valley to supply Los Angeles, which tribal leaders say has desiccated their ancestral homeland, destroying springs, meadows, and vital ecosystems. While the DWP maintains its water management is sustainable, the tribes argue the pumping continues to cause severe environmental harm and are seeking the return of both land and water rights.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York, following sustained pressure over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a personal statement, the prince said the continued accusations were distracting from the work of the Royal Family and that the decision was made in consultation with the King. While he will remain a prince, he will no longer use his titles or honours and will have an even more diminished public role, though he continues to deny all allegations against him.</p>

          <p>The Falls of Clyde, a 147-year-old sailing ship built on Scotland's River Clyde, has been intentionally sunk in deep water off the coast of Hawaii. The vessel had been a museum ship in Honolulu for decades but had fallen into severe disrepair. The decision by the Honolulu Harbour Board to scuttle the ship has sparked outrage among maritime conservation groups in both the U.S. and Scotland. These groups had spent years in fruitless negotiations trying to repatriate and restore the historic vessel, which was the last surviving iron-hulled, four-masted sailing ship.</p>
