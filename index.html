        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped nearly 17% in their Hong Kong trading debut. Investors are optimistic about the company's potential to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market, with the IPO raising HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion). CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. While facing challenges like punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs and being placed on a U.S. watchlist, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year despite a slight revenue drop.</p>

Kushner, previously pardoned by President Trump for federal tax evasion and FEC violations, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that his past mistakes have made him more qualified for the job. Kushner is the father of Jared Kushner, former advisor and son-in-law to Trump, who praised him as a tremendous business leader and dealmaker. The confirmation has stirred controversy due to Kushner's criminal history, but he believes his experiences have improved his judgment and values.</p>

Simultaneously, Habba's office charged Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting and interfering with law enforcement during the same incident at Delaney Hall. Baraka, a New Jersey gubernatorial candidate, criticized the ICE facility, while McIver denied the charges as politically motivated, claiming ICE agents created an unnecessary confrontation during a congressional visit.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with the European Union, the United States, and India, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with major trade partners post-Brexit. However, the deals required politically sensitive concessions, reflecting Britain's position as a midsize economy between larger trading blocs. The agreement with the EU allows British travelers easier access at some European airports, while the U.S. deal reduces tariffs on British luxury cars. Despite these agreements, Britain still faces economic challenges from Brexit, including a significant GDP loss, leading to debates over the deals' benefits and trade-offs, particularly regarding fishing rights and agricultural access.</p>

          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. This inflow contrasts with concerns about rising Treasury yields and the Moodyâ€™s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets since the trade war began. Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker U.S. dollar, a peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery are driving investment towards emerging markets.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, the president of the Kennedy Center, claimed that the center's deferred maintenance and deficit were "criminal" and would be referred to federal prosecutors. Grenell alleged that officials had found $26 million in phantom revenue. The Kennedy Center announced its upcoming season, which will feature some big names in theater and dance, but also includes touring Broadway shows with nonunion casts. This shift reflects changes at the center since Mr. Trump became its chairman, leading to divisions among artists about performing there.</p>

          <p>Two South Texas gang members, Juan Miguel Regalado and Samuel Grajeda Jr., were sentenced for human smuggling after leading law enforcement on high-speed chases near the border. Regalado received a 66-month sentence, while Grajeda received 30 months plus six months for violating supervised release. The investigation began in April 2024 when Regalado, driving a green Tahoe, crashed into the Rio Grande and swam to Mexico to escape. In November 2024, both men were involved in another incident where Grajeda crashed into a bystanderâ€™s vehicle during a pursuit.</p>

The report challenges the administration's claim that only undocumented individuals were deported to the Cecot mega-prison. The analysis found that 21 men were admitted at a port of entry, 24 were granted parole, four were resettled as refugees, and one entered on a tourist visa. The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration, allowing it to end legal protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans.</p>

The move is part of Beijing's efforts to stimulate its economy, with state-backed commercial lenders also reducing deposit rates. Capital Economics forecasts further lending rate cuts by year-end.
