          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older and individuals aged 12-64 with health conditions increasing their risk from the virus, offering a lower dose alternative to their existing vaccine, Spikevax. This approval arrives with limitations, distinguishing it from Moderna's original vaccine, which is available for anyone six months and older. The decision follows a study involving 11,400 participants, demonstrating the new vaccine's safety and effectiveness comparable to its predecessor. This announcement coincides with the Trump administration's cancellation of Moderna's funding for a pandemic flu vaccine and changes in CDC recommendations for children's COVID-19 vaccinations, sparking controversy and debate among health officials. The new approval adds a new tool to help protect those at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19.</p>

          <p>Despite being linked to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Aaron Rodgers' future in the NFL remains uncertain as he prioritizes his personal life and commitments. Rodgers, 41, has not guaranteed the Steelers that he will sign with the team and has not ruled out retirement, stating he is open to anything and attached to nothing. Voluntary offseason practices are underway, but it is unclear whether Rodgers will play football and sign with the Steelers after 20 seasons. Last season with the New York Jets, Rodgers threw for 3,987 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 17 games, while the Steelers went 10-7 with Russell Wilson and Justin Fields as their starting quarterbacks, both of whom have since departed. Rodgers is currently in a different phase of his life and has off-the-field matters requiring his attention.</p>

          <p>The White House has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman, CEO of Shift4, to become the next NASA administrator just days before his scheduled Senate confirmation vote. White House spokeswoman Elizabeth Huston stated that the next NASA administrator must align with President Trump's America First agenda, and a replacement will be announced soon. Isaacman, who has a long history with Elon Musk and SpaceX, had stated during his confirmation hearing that he would prioritize sending American astronauts to Mars. However, he attempted to distance himself from Musk during the hearing, clarifying that a lunar landing would take precedence over a Mars mission, possibly contributing to the White House's decision. Isaacman had previously expressed his commitment to ensuring America's leadership in space exploration and inspiring future generations.</p>

U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff deemed the response unacceptable and insisted Hamas accept the original framework. Israel has agreed to the updated Witkoff outline, but Hamas's continued refusal poses a challenge to reaching a resolution.

An analysis of satellite images suggests deforestation events on NGP land, indicating forests are cleared during regreening efforts.

Labarge, in turn, hired others who were charged, convicted, and sentenced for their involvement. Spofford had previously sued NHPR for defamation after the article was published, but the lawsuit was dismissed in 2023, with NHPR expressing gratitude to the Department of Justice for pursuing the case and defending press freedom.

          <p>Thousands of Bulgarians gathered in Sofia and other major cities to protest against the country's plans to adopt the euro, demanding a referendum on the issue. Critics fear the euro will harm Bulgaria's economy, fueled by mistrust of institutions and disinformation campaigns. Recent surveys indicate that nearly half of those questioned oppose Bulgaria joining the eurozone, with concerns about inflation and purchasing power. The pro-European majority in Bulgaria's parliament rejected the referendum proposal, accusing President Rumen Radev, who opposes the euro, of acting on behalf of Russia. The country is facing economic changes which bring more poverty.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, seeking amendments while affirming its commitment to a permanent ceasefire, Israeli military withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. The group's response includes a proposal to release 10 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 18 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff deemed the response unacceptable, advocating for Hamas to accept the original framework for proximity talks. Meanwhile, the U.N. Food Program reported that trucks carrying aid were stopped and offloaded by hungry Palestinians, highlighting the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza amid a nearly three-month blockade, as the people there are starving to death.</p>

          <p>Valerie Mahaffey, the Emmy-award winning actor known for her roles on Northern Exposure, Desperate Housewives and Young Sheldon, died on Friday at the age of 71. Her husband, actor Joseph Kell, said in a statement to Variety that America has lost one of its most endearing actresses. She was known for playing eccentric characters, including the one for which she won a supporting actress Emmy in 1992: as hypochondriac Eve living in the fictional Alaska town featured in Northern Exposure, which aired from 1990 to 1995. Mahaffey most recently received an Independent Spirit award nomination for her role as the optimistic Madame Reynard in Azazel Jacobs’ 2020 dark comedy French Exit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties that increase premiums for life; however, individuals covered by an employer-provided health insurance plan with 20 or more employees can typically delay enrollment without penalty. Delaying enrollment also allows continued contributions to a health savings account, which are disallowed upon Medicare enrollment. Medicare advises confirming appropriate coverage with the employer's benefits department before delaying application, to ensure you are appropriately covered and can delay your application. It is important to understand the rules and potential consequences of delaying Medicare enrollment to make informed decisions about healthcare coverage.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized the introduction of a new rule clamping down on front wing flexibility at the Spanish Grand Prix, calling it "a waste of money." The FIA imposed a stiffer load test on front wings to limit aerodynamic exploitation, but Hamilton stated it has changed nothing. He added that everyone's wings still bend, just half the bending, and everyone's had to make new wings and spend more money to make these. The Ferrari driver added that he "wasn't expecting" anything of the change before coming to Spain.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned of China posing an "imminent" threat to Taiwan, urging Asian countries to boost defence spending and collaborate with the US to deter war. He characterized China as seeking to become a "hegemonic power" and accused Beijing of preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in Asia. China responded by accusing the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace. The US wants a strong shield of deterrence forged with allies, said Hegseth, who promised the US would "continue to wrap our arms around our friends and find new ways to work together".</p>

          <p>The cost of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has risen at El Vacilon Grocery in Brooklyn due to soaring egg prices. Owners Freddy and Yovanna Melo increased the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, to maintain a profit margin of 20 to 30 percent. The pandemic has elevated the costs of various items, and the couple relies on rent from apartments above the store to sustain their business.

Under that canopy would be two crew sitting side-by-side, similar to the F-111 and Su-34’s arrangement, among others. The image also offers a view of the dorsal inlet on the three-engined aircraft, along with its diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) ‘hump,’ which appears very large here. The imagery also comes just days after the clearest look at Shenyang’s smaller, but still heavy-weight 6th generation fighter aircraft, referred to unofficially by a number of designations, including J-XDS and J-50.</p>

However, experts say the increase in US autism rates is mostly explained by the expanding definitions of the condition, as well as more awareness and more screening for it. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes that are associated with autism, building a convincing case that genetics are the most important driver of autism’s development.</p>
