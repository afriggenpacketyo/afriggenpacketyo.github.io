          <p>Two tickets, sold in Missouri and Texas, have won the massive $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, marking the second-largest prize in U.S. lottery history after a three-month period without a big winner. The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, and 62, with Powerball 17, and the ticketholders can choose between a lump sum of $410.3 million or $893.5 million paid over 30 years. This drawing was the 42nd since the last jackpot win on May 31, tying the game's record for consecutive drawings without a winner. The odds of winning were 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 24.9. The lottery is always a game of chance, and so the score of the drawing itself is ultimately random.</p>

          <p>Shaun Cassidy, former teen idol and son of Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, is embarking on his first major tour in 45 years, after focusing on a behind-the-scenes career as a television writer and producer. Cassidy has been relearning his own hits and brushing up on his guitar skills, taking guitar lessons and rediscovering songs he wrote. His 50-city "The Road to Us Tour" will kick off at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, and will feature classic hits, new music, and personal stories from his career. Cassidy admits he never enjoyed being a public figure and prefers being behind the scenes, but he is embracing the challenge of returning to the stage. The tour will include his hit song "Da Doo Ron Ron," but he is glad to be able to sing songs he likes, and feels that he can sing better now because he hasn't burnt his voice out. </p>

          <p>UCLA's football team lost to UNLV 30-23, highlighting ongoing problems with the defense and offense. Despite a late comeback attempt, an interception ended UCLA's hopes, marking their first 0-2 start since 2019. Coach DeShaun Foster acknowledged the team's shortcomings after reviewing footage from their previous loss. The article details key moments in the game, including a promising third quarter and a failed fourth-down conversion. The loss to a Mountain West Conference opponent increases the pressure on Foster early in his second season, raising questions about the team's performance.</p>

          <p>A Russian overnight drone attack on Kyiv has killed at least two people, including a one-year-old baby, and injured 11 others, according to local officials. The attack partially destroyed several multi-story residential buildings, causing fires in the Svyatoshynkyi and Darnytskyi districts. Russian strikes also targeted Kryvyi Rih, President Zelensky's hometown, hitting three infrastructure facilities, and air raid warnings were activated across Ukraine. This attack follows Putin's warning to the West against aiding Ukraine, and Russia's military has not commented on the reported drone strikes. The fresh attacks are not something to be optimistic about, as the drones are not harmless.</p>

          <p>Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in Brooklyn to address the threat of oligarchic control in the U.S., drawing a crowd of 1,700 people. Mamdani condemned capitalistic greed and vowed to freeze rent prices, increase housing, and raise taxes for New York's richest 1%. Sanders praised Mamdani's campaign as a grassroots movement challenging billionaire donors and tech oligarchs allied with Trump. The article highlights the muted response from mainstream Democrats and Mamdani's plans to defend immigrant communities. The article also notes that Eric Adams reaffirmed his plan to remain in the mayoral race, despite reports that Trump has been allegedly encouraging him to drop out of the race in order to help Cuomo beat Mamdani.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian air attacks on Kyiv caused a fire in an administrative government building, according to Ukrainian officials. Falling debris from downed drones ignited fires in residential buildings, resulting in at least two deaths, including a one-year-old child. Explosions were reported in multiple Ukrainian cities, and Poland scrambled its fighter jets during the air raid to protect its airspace. Ukraine's overnight drones sparked a fire at an oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, but no casualties were reported there. Despite diplomatic efforts, fighting continues, and Russia currently occupies about 20% of Ukrainian territory.</p>

Powerball tickets are sold in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and cost $2 each.

          <p>A US-China team has developed a method to launch millimetre-scale jumpers using the energy from collapsing vapour bubbles. The process involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. The sudden collapse of these bubbles releases energy, creating a force that can launch the jumpers 1.5 metres into the air. By controlling the light flow, scientists can manipulate the launch direction and even make the materials swim. The researchers demonstrate that cavitation can serve as an efficient launching mechanism, and this could be used in the future to explore the world.</p>

Illinois had approximately 550,000 unauthorized immigrants in 2023, and the governor expressed concerns about ICE targeting attendees at the Mexican Independence Day events.

After a man grabbed the ball and gave it to the boy, a woman berated him, claiming the ball was hers and took it back. The Marlins gave the boy a gift bag, and the Phillies arranged for him to meet the player who hit the home run, Harrison Bader, who gave him an autographed bat. The young Phillies fan also got to see his team win, defeating the Marlins 9-3. It is always great to see people be generous.</p>

          <p>Chicago is bracing for additional immigration enforcement, and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson are pushing back against President Trump's threats to send in federal troops. Pritzker warned of a surge in ICE agents, and city officials are preparing for increased activity in communities. A Mexican Independence Day festival was postponed due to concerns over ICE activity, and protesters gathered to oppose the expected immigration crackdown. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the enforcement is targeting the "worst of the worst" criminals. The government has been working to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Recent market instability and cabinet reshuffles will influence Rachel Reeves' upcoming Budget, and the security of Reeves' position was apparent after the market reacted negatively to the thought of her leaving office. Global bond markets have been fragile, with some economists suggesting a potential £50bn black hole requiring IMF loans. Reeves dismissed these concerns, attributing bond market movements to global trends rather than UK-specific issues. The chancellor's team will likely use bond market volatility to argue against increasing debt, advocating for higher taxes or lower spending, and the OBR's productivity assessment will significantly impact the budget.

          <p>Mount Sinai, revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is at the center of controversy due to plans to transform it into a luxury mega-resort. The project includes luxury hotels, villas, and shopping bazaars, raising concerns about the preservation of the site's unique characteristics. The local Bedouin community has reportedly had their homes and tourist eco-camps demolished with little or no compensation. Critics argue that the development is imposed on the Bedouin against their will, serving the interests of outsiders over the local community. It is important to preserve these sacred sites.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration enforcement operation in Massachusetts, targeting immigrants for arrest and deportation. The operation, called Patriot 2.0, is a modified version of a previous surge that led to 1,500 arrests. The operation focuses on immigrants released from custody despite ICE agents attempting to apprehend them, and tensions have been rising between the administration and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu over sanctuary policies. Wu's administration is preparing for the possibility of a federal national guard deployment, and the acting ICE director has stated the agency's intent to target sanctuary jurisdictions. It is important to have a fair and just immigration system.</p>

          <p>Both Ukraine and Russia are using decoys to deceive the enemy and conserve valuable resources, and Ukraine employs full-scale models of military equipment, including flat-pack artillery and inflatable tanks. Volunteer groups play a crucial role in supplying these mock-ups, with some models costing only a few hundred dollars. Russian forces are also using decoys, including cheap drone imitations to overload Ukrainian air defenses. Success depends on realistic deployment, such as recreating positions with wheel ruts and even toilets, and this makes it very difficult to be successful on the battlefield. </p>
