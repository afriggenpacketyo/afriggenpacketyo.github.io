          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a low-cost, edible, and washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. Tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangos, the coating effectively delayed rot by almost a week or more. The new method is as effective as existing preservation techniques but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste. The research team emphasized the coating's universal applicability for post-harvest and fresh-cut fruits due to its edible properties, easy washability, and low cost, costing just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar surges in April and March. The Japanese government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate the price of the country's staple food. This price spike occurs as Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest level since January 2023, with rice accounting for approximately 50% of the core inflation. While government measures to reduce rice prices could boost household spending, the impact will depend on whether the reductions extend to processed foods and restaurant prices (not investment advice).</p>

Sakamoto expressed that she feels she has less than a year left in competition and aims to conclude her career the year she turns 26.

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart, the toymaker behind Labubu dolls, experienced a decline after Morgan Stanley removed the stock from a focus list and Chinese state media called for stricter regulation of "blind box" toys. The People's Daily criticized speculation around the blind box phenomenon, advocating for stronger regulation, particularly concerning children's spending habits. Additionally, China's customs agency highlighted instances of intercepted Labubu copycats attempting to cross the border. Pop Mart's Hong Kong-listed shares were down more than 5%, marking its first negative week since early May, although year-to-date gains remain over 160%.</p>

"The Tetsuwan Dash" will continue broadcasting without Kokubun, who debuted with Tokio in 1994 and has had an extensive career in television and radio.

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of military action against Iran's Fordo nuclear site, with sources indicating he believes disabling it is necessary due to the risk of rapid weapons production. While attack plans have been approved, a final decision on whether to strike and formally join Israel's air campaign has not been made, pending potential negotiations with Iran. The White House press secretary stated that Trump will decide within two weeks, considering diplomatic efforts led by the U.K. and other European nations to find a resolution. Trump is also reviewing the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs and the possibility of Iran disabling Fordo on its own.</p>

Many games are scheduled at midday or in the early afternoon, contributing to the impact of the hot and humid summer weather on both play and attendance.

          <p>A federal appeals court extended its block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The ruling allows for the continued deployment of approximately 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they have been protecting federal property and U.S. immigration agents during enforcement operations. Newsom objects to the use of troops and sued the president, but the court sided with Trump, stating that he lawfully exercised his statutory authority under Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents. Newsom expressed disappointment with the ruling, vowing to press forward with the challenge.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has allowed President Trump to retain control over California's National Guard, amidst a lawsuit from Governor Gavin Newsom challenging the legality of the troops' deployment to quell protests in Los Angeles. The court extended a pause on a previous ruling that deemed Trump's call of the National Guard into federal service unlawful. Newsom argued that Trump failed to coordinate with the governor and that conditions for federalizing the Guard, such as a rebellion against federal authority, did not exist. The Trump administration maintains that the troops are protecting federal buildings and personnel, not engaging in civilian law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's efforts to attract investment may ironically undermine corporate spending, exemplified by the Nippon Steel Corp.'s acquisition of United States Steel Corp. The U.S. administration's initial blocking of the $14.1 billion deal, driven by political motives, raises concerns about the vulnerability of businesses in the U.S. market. This wrangling could deter global companies from making substantial investments and acquisitions in the U.S., prompting them to reduce their exposure.

          <p>As the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" is marked, Americans are paying tribute to sharks amidst recent reports of attacks. Despite these incidents, activist Julie Andersen of Shark Angels argues that the rise in sightings is due to more people in the water, better technology, and shifting ocean conditions, rather than an increase in shark populations. She highlights the rebounding white shark populations in areas like California and Cape Cod as a sign of healthier oceans. Shark Angels provides tips for staying safe in the water, including remaining calm, maintaining eye contact, and avoiding erratic movements, emphasizing that sharks are not actively seeking human meals.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against planned cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft stated that while she understands the need to address the increasing welfare bill, cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. A government spokesman responded that the reforms aim to fix a broken welfare system by ensuring those who can work should, those who want to work are supported, and those with the most severe disabilities are protected. The government's bill tightens criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit, potentially facing a large rebellion from its own backbenchers.</p>

          <p>China's central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures implemented last month, as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with Reuters poll estimates. Last month, Chinese authorities cut lending rates for the first time since October to cushion the impact of trade tensions with Washington (not investment advice). Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor a consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs.</p>
