          <p>At least two firefighters were killed in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being targeted by sniper fire while responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain. The Kootenai County Sheriff confirmed that first responders are facing an active and dynamic threat from a suspect, or suspects, using high-powered rifles from a concealed position in heavy brush. The ongoing attack has complicated firefighting efforts and the evacuation of civilians still on the mountain, prompting a massive law enforcement response from local, state, and federal agencies. Authorities have stated they are prepared to neutralize the threat, which could develop into a multi-day operation.</p>

          <p>Two elementary school teachers in Japan were arrested for allegedly taking indecent photos of female students and sharing them in a private social media group with other educators. The group chat, which included about eight other teachers, contained around 70 videos and photos, some apparently taken at school with a school camera. The case has sparked significant public concern about child safety in schools and came to light during a separate investigation into another teacher in the group. This incident has intensified calls for stronger measures to protect students, including the implementation of a new background check system for school employees.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing body of research indicates they are more likely to cause motion sickness than traditional internal combustion engine cars. Studies point to the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, as a primary cause. This system, which recharges the battery by converting kinetic energy during slowdowns, creates low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness and discomfort in passengers. Researchers are now exploring solutions to mitigate this effect and improve the passenger experience in the rapidly expanding EV market.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came just hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The conflict arose from Tillis's opposition to the massive Republican spending and tax bill, which he argued would be devastating for his state due to deep cuts to Medicaid. In his announcement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington, stating the choice was between more political gridlock or spending time with his family. His departure opens up a critical Senate seat in a key state.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy from Sun Valley, who was allegedly murdered by his youth soccer coach, died of acute alcohol intoxication, according to the family's civil attorney. The victim, Oscar Omar Hernandez, was found dead in a roadside ditch after visiting the coach, Mario Edgardo Garcia Aquino, at his home. Garcia Aquino has been charged with murder with a special circumstance of committing the act during lewd acts with a child. This revelation about the cause of death raises further questions about the circumstances leading to the tragedy, especially since the coach was previously investigated for other instances of alleged misconduct with minors.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained in contraction territory for the third straight month in June, signaling persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy. The PMI registered at 49.7, slightly up from May but still below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The manufacturing sector is struggling with sluggish consumer demand, a deepening price war, and the impact of higher U.S. tariffs, which have significantly reduced exports. These ongoing challenges, coupled with deflationary pressures, are fueling expectations that Beijing will introduce more stimulus measures to support economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" on Iran's nuclear facilities but did not completely destroy them. He cautioned that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its activities if it chooses to do so. Grossi's assessment appears to temper claims from U.S. officials that the program was "obliterated." He also raised concerns about the location of Iran's enriched uranium, noting it's logical to presume it may have been moved as a protective measure, and stressed the urgent need for inspectors to regain access to verify the situation.</p>

Despite homosexuality not being a crime in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government has adopted increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community.

The blast, which occurred before 5 a.m., affected at least seven properties and prompted the evacuation of nearby residents as a precautionary measure. The two injured individuals, an 82-year-old woman and a 62-year-old woman, were hospitalized. The cause of the explosion is under a slow and methodical investigation by multiple agencies, including the fire marshal's office and the ATF, to determine the cause and prevent any secondary collapses.</p>

          <p>A female prosecutor in Osaka, Japan, has come forward with allegations that she was sexually assaulted by her former boss, a chief prosecutor, in 2018. The prosecutor, identified by the pseudonym Hikari, claims she has since faced a campaign to silence her and has been slandered by a colleague, which she describes as further victimization. The accused former chief, Kentaro Kitagawa, was indicted and initially admitted to the charge but later claimed the encounter was consensual. Hikari's case highlights the challenges victims face within Japan's hierarchical justice system and has become a prominent 'MeToo' moment for the country.</p>

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a US expert on Chinese law at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that historical precedent indicates US-China relations can survive the current period of disruption. Drawing parallels to the post-1989 era, he notes that American students and scholars are once again pioneers in returning to China after a period of reduced exchange, this time due to the pandemic. Mahboubi, who recently led a student trip to China, observed a warm and welcoming reception, which he interprets as a sign of underlying desire for connection despite high-level political tensions. He believes that people-to-people exchanges remain a vital component of the bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski provided a significant boost with a standout performance, pitching six scoreless innings in a 5-1 victory against the Kansas City Royals. Entering the game in the second inning, the 24-year-old left-hander allowed just three hits and struck out six, continuing his impressive midseason resurgence. Wrobleski's recent success is attributed to increased fastball velocity and improved mechanics, which have helped him solidify his role as a valuable depth option for the team. The win clinched the series for the Dodgers and capped a successful 5-1 road trip.</p>
