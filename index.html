        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro following his remarks at a protest in New York City. During a demonstration concerning the war in Gaza, Petro urged American soldiers to disobey orders from President Donald Trump, which the State Department deemed "reckless and incendiary." This action marks a significant escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Colombia, a traditionally close ally in Latin America. The incident adds to a series of recent diplomatic clashes between Petro's leftist government and the Trump administration over issues like anti-narcotics efforts.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have resulted in at least 57 fatalities across Gaza, according to health officials, escalating the humanitarian crisis. Despite increasing international pressure for a ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirmed his commitment to continuing the war against Hamas in a defiant address to the United Nations. The ongoing military operations have severely impacted Gaza's hospitals, which are facing critical shortages of supplies and have been damaged by strikes. The conflict has led to over 65,000 deaths, with aid organizations suspending activities due to the extreme risks involved.</p>

          <p>A man in his 50s has died and seven other individuals, including emergency responders, received treatment for suspected carbon monoxide poisoning at a takeaway shop in Bloxwich, West Midlands. The incident occurred on Friday night at a pizza parlor that was undergoing refurbishment. Local officials believe a generator being operated without sufficient ventilation released the toxic gases, leading to the tragedy. Nearby properties were temporarily evacuated as a precaution, and police are now collaborating with the Health and Safety Executive to investigate the exact circumstances of the man's death.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the deployment of troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" to address what he describes as attacks by "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists" on federal facilities. This move has been met with strong opposition from local and state officials, who did not request federal intervention and accuse the president of fabricating a crisis to justify an authoritarian crackdown. Oregon's senators and representatives argue that Trump is misrepresenting small, peaceful protests to create chaos for political purposes. The White House has not yet provided specific details on the timeline or the type of troops to be deployed.</p>

          <p>Denmark's defense ministry has reported multiple drone sightings over several of its military facilities, including the major air bases at Skrydstrup and Karup. This follows a series of similar incidents that temporarily shut down civilian airports in Denmark and Norway earlier in the week, heightening security concerns across Northern Europe. While no one has been accused of responsibility, the repeated and sophisticated nature of the drone activity has led to an increased state of alert. In response, NATO has announced a new "Eastern Sentry" activity to provide a resolute response to reckless airspace violations in the region.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) has generated significant controversy after posting a tribute on social media honoring the life of Assata Shakur, who recently died in Cuba. Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, was convicted in 1977 for the murder of a New Jersey State Trooper and was on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists list after escaping from prison and fleeing to Cuba. The union's post, which called Shakur a "revolutionary fighter" and a "leader of freedom," drew immediate and harsh criticism. Critics condemned the CTU for celebrating a convicted cop-killer, highlighting it as another example of the union's controversial political stances.</p>

          <p>After more than three decades, Austin police have identified a suspect in the infamous 1991 quadruple murder at an I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop. Through advanced DNA testing, investigators linked Robert Eugene Brashers to the crime that claimed the lives of four teenage girls. Brashers, who had a violent criminal history including a conviction for the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl, died by suicide in 1999. This breakthrough brings a potential resolution to a case that shocked the nation and previously led to the wrongful convictions of two men, who were later exonerated by DNA evidence and released in 2009.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis discovered that their social media photos were used without consent to create explicit deepfake content on a "nudify" website, sparking a movement to fight against AI-generated pornography. The incident highlights a significant legal loophole, as the creation of such content is often not illegal if the images are not distributed and the subjects are not minors. This has led victims to lobby for new legislation, such as a proposed Minnesota bill that would fine AI companies for enabling these services. The case underscores the growing problem of easily accessible AI tools being used to cause psychological trauma and violate personal privacy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new 100% tariff on all imported branded or patented pharmaceutical products, set to take effect on October 1, 2025. The move is intended to pressure drugmakers to move their manufacturing operations to the United States. The tariffs will not apply to generic drugs or to companies that are actively building or have broken ground on new manufacturing plants in America. This policy is expected to significantly impact European and Asian pharmaceutical companies, which are major exporters to the U.S., and could lead to higher drug prices for American consumers.

The lawsuit, which seeks over $60 million in damages, alleges this was done to silence him after he raised questions about player scandals that could have implicated the league.

          <h2>Stock Market Resilience May Be Masking Underlying Economic Vulnerabilities</h2>

          <p>Despite concerns about tariffs and a slow jobs market, a robust stock market is fueling consumer spending and potentially keeping the U.S. economy from a recession. Recent economic data shows surprisingly strong consumer spending, durable goods orders, and new home sales, largely driven by the wealth effect among the top 10% of earners who own 87% of the stock market. However, economists warn that this creates a vulnerability; if the market turns, a rise in the savings rate combined with stagnant job growth could trigger a recession. This highlights a precarious economic balance reliant on continued market strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has relocated to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he lives a comfortable life on approximately $4,000 a month. His income is sourced from VA disability benefits, the GI Bill for his master's degree studies, and part-time work teaching English. Ryan contrasts the low cost of living and sense of safety in Vietnam with the financial pressures and lack of motivation he felt in the U.S., stating that life abroad allows him to focus on personal happiness and growth rather than just survival. He highlights the ability to escape a cycle of poverty and pursue personal goals as a key benefit of his expatriate life.</p>

          <p>Anson Funds, an activist investment firm, is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO), a major out-of-home advertising company. This move follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners in 2023, which led CCO to divest its international assets and become a U.S. pure-play business. Despite these changes, CCO's stock has underperformed, trading at a lower multiple than its peers. Anson argues that a sale is the best path forward for shareholders, given the company's significant debt and the slow pace of its high-value digital billboard conversion. (not investment advice)</p>

The company claims its manufacturing process can cut expenses by up to 20% and build a home in half the time of traditional on-site methods. Recently, Fading West demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 modular homes in two months for residents displaced by the 2023 wildfires in Lahaina, Maui. By focusing on value engineering and efficient production, the company aims to make home ownership more attainable for workers in high-cost areas and beyond.</p>

          <p>The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has voted to lift all sanctions against Russia and Belarus, which were imposed following the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The decision, made at the IPC's general assembly in Seoul, restores full membership rights to the National Paralympic Committees of both countries. This means Russian and Belarusian athletes could potentially compete under their own flags at the 2026 Winter Paralympics in Milan-Cortina.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent statements on the U.S. economy reveals a mix of accurate and misleading claims. While mortgage rates and gasoline prices have indeed decreased recently, his assertions that grocery and energy costs are down are incorrect, as federal data shows increases in both categories over the past year. Furthermore, his claim to have "defeated" inflation is contradicted by a Consumer Price Index that remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. While the stock market has reached record highs, manufacturing employment has seen a net decline since April, complicating the narrative of a universally booming economy. (not investment advice)</p>

May, who resigned from his legislative seat earlier this year, faces five to twenty years in prison for each of the five counts.

          <p>President Trump's recent comments advising pregnant women to "tough it out" and avoid taking Tylenol have drawn sharp criticism. The article argues that his unsubstantiated linking of acetaminophen to autism is irresponsible and reflects a broader pattern of ignoring and downplaying women's pain within the medical establishment. The author contends that this advice is not based on scientific evidence and is another example of shaming women for their health choices during pregnancy. This "war on Tylenol" is framed as a misogynistic attempt to control women's bodies rather than a genuine concern for their health.</p>
