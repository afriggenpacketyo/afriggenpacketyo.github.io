          <p>Italian boxer Angela Carini has reported receiving extensive online abuse after controversially withdrawing from her Olympic match against Algeria's Imane Khelif. Carini quit the bout after just 46 seconds, citing pain from Khelif's punches, which ignited a global debate on gender eligibility in women's sports, drawing comments from figures like Donald Trump. She stated the incident has "destroyed" her career, despite her subsequent return to the ring where she won her eighth Italian title and a World Boxing Cup gold. Carini published screenshots of the abuse, urging people to reflect on the impact of their words, while the IOC defended the Olympic results and the IBA pushed for Khelif's medal to be stripped.</p>

          <p>Authorities have apprehended 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Kirk, 31, was killed during an outdoor debate, in what officials describe as a "targeted attack" that drew widespread condemnation. Robinson, who is not a university student, was arrested on charges including aggravated murder, with his father reportedly urging him to surrender after recognizing his son from released photos. Investigators recovered a high-powered rifle and bullet casings with unusual inscriptions from a wooded area where the suspect fled, as the FBI offered a $100,000 reward for information.</p>

The statement from the Taliban's foreign ministry included photographs of their foreign minister meeting with U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Response, Adam Boehler, and former envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. While the Taliban provided no specific details on the number or identities of detainees, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed ongoing conversations but did not confirm the agreement details, stating the president would make final decisions. This development follows the Taliban's recent release of two U.S. citizens and comes after they criticized the new U.S. travel ban on Afghans.</p>

The "Unite the Kingdom" rally, featuring speeches from figures like Elon Musk, saw initial peaceful demonstrations, but later experienced "unacceptable violence" against police, resulting in nine arrests. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the attacks on officers, with approximately 1,500 police deployed to separate the groups. The event underscored rising anti-immigration sentiment in Britain and fueled broader debates over free speech and public order, as some participants also expressed support for slain U.S. activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes have intensified across Gaza City, resulting in at least 32 deaths, including 12 children, as reported by Shifa Hospital morgue staff. Israel, urging residents to evacuate south, stated its offensive targets Hamas strongholds and surveillance equipment in high-rise buildings, though hundreds of thousands remain in famine-stricken conditions. Concurrently, relatives of Israeli hostages rallied in Tel Aviv, criticizing Prime Minister Netanyahu's approach after a failed assassination attempt on Hamas leaders in Qatar, which they believed jeopardized negotiations. The war, which began in October 2023, has led to over 64,000 Palestinian deaths and widespread displacement, with a dire humanitarian crisis exacerbating malnutrition-related fatalities.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin is facing intense pressure and questioning over his future after the club's worst start to a league season in 47 years. Following a 2-0 home defeat to Hearts, which left Rangers 10th after five winless games, Martin's firm "no" to resignation was met with hostile fan reaction. The team's dismal performance, including a humiliating Champions League exit, has led to widespread calls for his departure from supporters who had hoped for a renewed title challenge. Martin acknowledged the difficult journey to win favor, while former players and fans expressed significant doubts about his ability to turn the tide given the club's demands.</p>

Authorities have ruled out additional victims trapped under rubble, but residents of nine housing units in the unstable building will require rehousing for at least a few days.

Neighboring nations, particularly Poland and Lithuania, are on high alert, recalling how Zapad 2021 preceded Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Poland has responded by closing its border with Belarus and launching its own "Iron Defender" exercises with 30,000 troops, reflecting heightened concerns about potential Russian aggression and recent airspace incursions.

          <p>President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to NATO allies, stating the U.S. will impose "major" sanctions on Russia only if they agree to do the same and cease all Russian oil purchases. Trump also called for NATO countries to levy 50% to 100% tariffs on China, to be withdrawn after the Ukraine war, asserting these steps would swiftly end the conflict. This demand represents a significant departure from existing policies, as many European nations still import Russian fossil fuels despite an EU ban on maritime oil.

Attorneys argue U.S. officials lack authority to deport children without asylum hearings, highlighting severe risks like gang violence, physical abuse, and neglect in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.

          <h2>Nepal's Major Parties Demand Reinstatement of Dissolved Parliament Amid Political Crisis</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nepal's eight major political parties have demanded President Ram Chandra Poudel reinstate the parliament he dissolved, arguing his action was unconstitutional and against judicial precedents. The dissolution followed deadly anti-corruption protests and the appointment of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki, a key demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement. Over 50 people died in clashes during the week's mass protests, initially sparked by a social media ban that quickly broadened to embody deep discontent with Nepal's political elite. President Poudel urged restraint and called for elections within six months, while Karki, the first woman to lead Nepal, faces challenges in restoring order and reassuring a fragile democracy.</p>

          <p>Illinois lawmakers and officials are demanding an investigation into the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during a traffic stop in Franklin Park. They argue that a "traffic violation should never amount to a death sentence" and link the incident to the Trump administration's "anti-immigrant agenda." ICE claims Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest, attempted to flee, and dragged an officer, while surveillance videos show agents breaking into his car after it crashed. The killing, which occurred near a school, has sparked outrage, especially as ICE ramps up operations in Chicago and faces scrutiny over past warrantless arrests and its "Operation Midway Blitz."</p>

The Gunners have won three of their first four league games without conceding from open play, a significant improvement from last season's title challenge falter. Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown praised the team's strength and quality, highlighting individual performances from players like Noni Madueke, who was exceptional.</p>

          <p>California's State Assembly has passed SB 53, a bill requiring transparency reports from developers of powerful "frontier" AI models, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature. The legislation targets "catastrophic risks" like AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks, defining them as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages. SB 53 mandates safety frameworks, critical incident reporting, and whistleblower protections, with potential $1 million fines for violations. While proponents see it as a "light touch" policy to encourage safety and set a national precedent, critics worry about compliance costs and stifling innovation, debating its effectiveness in preventing future large-scale disasters, and whether its focus is too narrow.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, has pledged to order the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he travels to New York while Mamdani is mayor. Citing an international criminal court (ICC) arrest warrant issued in November 2024 for alleged Gaza war crimes, Mamdani stated his intent to uphold international law. Legal experts, however, deem such an arrest "a practical impossibility" and a potential conflict with the federal government, as the U.S. does not recognize the ICC's authority and President Trump previously sanctioned the ICC. This controversial stance comes as polling indicates growing New Yorker support for Palestinians and could provoke strong reactions in the city's large Jewish community.</p>

Mutlu, from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), denied the charges, calling them "political operations and baseless slander" on social media. This incident is part of a widening crackdown on the CHP, which has seen over a dozen mayors and hundreds of staff arrested recently, including Ekrem Imamoglu, a key challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The government maintains judicial independence, but critics view these arrests as politically motivated attempts to undermine the opposition, with an Ankara court set to decide on annulling the CHP's 2023 party conference outcome.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook referred to a condominium she purchased as a "vacation home" in loan documents, a characterization that could undermine President Donald Trump's mortgage fraud claims against her. Trump sought to fire Cook "for cause," alleging she claimed two properties as primary residences simultaneously, as he looks to reshape the central bank to orchestrate steep interest rate cuts. Cook, who sued to block her firing, secured an injunction allowing her to remain a Fed governor, with the administration appealing the ruling. The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the allegations, while Cook's tax records show no homestead exemption on the condo. (not investment advice)</p>
