          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as a patron by three charities following the emergence of a 2011 email in which she referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The charities, including a children's hospice, stated it was inappropriate for her to continue in her role. A spokesperson for the duchess explained the email was sent to counter a legal threat from Epstein and that she regrets any association with him. This development adds to the scrutiny surrounding the royal family's connections to Epstein, which previously led to Prince Andrew stepping down from public duties.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced a deal to acquire weight-loss drugmaker Metsera for an enterprise value of $4.9 billion, which could rise to $7.3 billion based on future milestones. This strategic move aims to bolster Pfizer's position in the lucrative obesity drug market after the company faced significant setbacks with its own candidates. Metsera brings a promising pipeline of oral and injectable treatments, including a GLP-1 drug that showed positive results in early trials. The acquisition is seen by analysts as a way for Pfizer to accelerate its entry and compete with market leaders Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.</p>

The closures will result in the loss of 444 jobs, adding to the more than one thousand employees who have lost their jobs since the company collapsed earlier in the month. Founded in 1970, the retailer was known for its warehouse-style stores packed with discounted goods. Administrators stated that the business was no longer viable to continue trading but will explore options for the company's assets, including the brand name.</p>

Her severely decomposed remains were found after the car was impounded in the Hollywood Hills. Rivas had been reported missing multiple times over the past year, and her family had been actively searching for her. The case has raised questions about her relationship with the 20-year-old singer, who has reportedly retained a lawyer and canceled upcoming tour dates as the investigation into the teen's death continues.</p>

          <p>Meta's new AI-powered smart glasses are being adopted by the blind and visually impaired community as a tool to enhance daily independence. The technology, when paired with apps like "Be My Eyes," connects users with volunteers or uses AI to perform tasks such as reading menus, identifying objects, and navigating public spaces. While advocates like the National Federation of the Blind praise the technology as a useful step forward, they also note its current limitations, such as battery life and occasional inaccuracies.

          <p>A senior White House official has clarified the terms of a preliminary deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, stating that the federal government will not take an equity stake or a "golden share" in the new entity. The popular video app's U.S. operations will be based in a new joint venture with a majority-American board of directors, and tech giant Oracle will be responsible for overseeing its security operations. This structure addresses national security concerns raised by Congress about the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, while allowing the platform to continue operating in the United States.</p>

There are concerns that the attackers could still be inside the system, potentially using the initial disruption as leverage for a larger extortion attempt.</p>

          <p>A recent anti-corruption rebellion led by urban youth in Nepal successfully ousted the government, highlighting deep-seated public frustration with a lack of opportunities and cronyism. This political shift in the Himalayan nation, which is strategically located between India and China, has significant geopolitical implications. Analysts are examining the extent of domestic versus foreign influence in the upheaval, as global powers like India, China, and the United States all have vested interests in Nepal's stability. The country's long-standing policy of non-alignment faces a complex test amid these internal and external pressures.</p>

          <p>The number of "solopreneurs," or businesses with no paid employees, is booming in the United States, now contributing $1.7 trillion to the national economy. This trend is fueled by a convergence of factors, including the accessibility of artificial intelligence as a virtual assistant and the power of social media platforms like TikTok to build a customer base instantly. Experts note that technology has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for starting a business. This economic shift also reflects a growing preference among workers for flexibility, autonomy, and purpose over traditional corporate career paths.</p>

          <p>A court in Delhi has issued an injunction against nine journalists and digital platforms, restricting them from publishing content that the Adani Group deems defamatory, sparking significant press freedom concerns in India. The order, which was enforced rapidly by the government, led to the takedown of nearly 140 YouTube videos and over 80 Instagram posts. Critics, including the Editors Guild of India, argue that the "ex parte" nature of the ruling, issued without hearing from the journalists, sets a troubling precedent for pre-publication censorship and allows a private corporation to wield excessive power over public discourse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's imports of crude oil from Russia saw a 15.2% year-on-year decline in August, a dip that analysts suggest is a temporary fluctuation rather than a broader trend. The reduction is largely attributed to scheduled maintenance at key Russian production facilities, such as the Sakhalin-1 project. This decrease in Russian supply was offset by a sharp increase in purchases from other countries, including a 50.4% jump from Brazil. Meanwhile, China's crude oil imports from the United States remained at zero for the third consecutive month amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

The drone's appearance at an air show confirms years of speculation that the military was repurposing its vast fleet of legacy aircraft for unmanned missions. Military analysts suggest that these converted jets, while technologically outdated as piloted fighters, could be deployed in large numbers as a low-cost option for swarm attacks in a potential conflict over the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's investigation into alleged antisemitism at UC Berkeley, which involves the prominent Jewish scholar Judith Butler, is a politically motivated attack on academic freedom. The author draws a direct parallel to the McCarthy era, when the U.S. government targeted leftist Jews under the guise of fighting communism. The article contends that this action is an attempt to enforce a narrow, acceptable form of Jewish politics and calls on the American Jewish community to stand in solidarity with all its members, including dissenters, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of Donald Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy, arguing that it has severely damaged American credibility on the global stage. The author contends that the president's tendency to break commitments, even those he negotiated himself, has taught both allies and adversaries that the U.S. cannot be trusted to keep its word. This erosion of trust has weakened alliances, left partners feeling exposed, and created a target-rich environment for rivals like China and Russia to expand their influence, ultimately accelerating a decline in America's global position.</p>

The author notes that while the restaurant features slick, retro-futuristic architecture, it serves mediocre fast food and functions more as a backdrop for social media than a serious dining experience. The critique argues that the diner is a "failure of imagination," representing not a vision for the future but rather the past's idea of the future, with little innovation in its food or function beyond providing a place for Tesla owners to wait while their cars charge.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve beginning a cycle of interest rate cuts, financial experts are advising savers that the high returns recently seen on cash will diminish. As rates on high-yield savings accounts and money market funds are expected to fall, now may be an opportune time to lock in higher rates for a fixed period. Certified financial planners suggest considering Certificates of Deposit (CDs), which allow savers to secure a specific return for a set duration, such as one to five years. However, it is important to balance the higher returns of CDs with the need for liquidity for emergency funds. (not investment advice)</p>

While further rate cuts from the Fed are anticipated, experts caution that their impact on mortgage rates is indirect and that any future drops will likely be gradual rather than dramatic.
