          <p>England's Women's Six Nations match against France is crucial for securing the Grand Slam, with France posing a significant threat due to their attacking flair and tactical kicking game. England's coach, Mitchell, emphasizes the importance of accuracy in kicking to win the territorial battle and shut down opportunities for France's dangerous backs. Fly-half Zoe Harrison's tactical kicking is expected to play a key role in finding space behind France's back three, potentially securing a starting spot before the home Rugby World Cup. France's scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus is a standout player who can create magic moments at any time.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive, shortly after his sentencing for tax crimes. Walczak's mother, Elizabeth Fago, was involved in efforts to publicize Ashley Biden's diary during the 2020 presidential campaign. Fago, a Republican donor, was contacted by someone possessing the diary, which contained sensitive information about Ashley Biden's recovery from addiction. The pardon raises questions about the intersection of political motivations and presidential clemency.</p>
