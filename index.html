          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to prevent the deputization of local police, demands federal agents be clearly identifiable, and directs city departments to provide information on residents' rights. This preemptive measure reflects growing tensions between the city and the Trump administration over law enforcement and immigration policies, with the mayor vowing to use all available legal tools to challenge federal overreach.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers nationwide reported significant service disruptions on Saturday, with many phones being restricted to "SOS mode," which only allows for emergency calls. The company acknowledged a software issue was impacting its wireless service and stated its engineers were actively working to resolve the problem. Reports of outages, tracked by DownDetector and social media, peaked in the afternoon and spanned from California to Florida, causing widespread frustration among users who rely on the network for daily communication and work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is advancing a plan to rebrand the Department of Defense back to its original name, the Department of War, a title it held until after World War II. President Trump has publicly supported the change, arguing that the name "War" better reflects the military's offensive capabilities and historical victories. While the administration suggests the change could happen soon, it would legally require an act of Congress to amend the law that established the department's current name, though an informal rebranding could also occur.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An in-depth article explores the largely unregulated for-profit industry of "body brokers" in the United States, who acquire and dissect donated human bodies to sell parts for medical research. Unlike in Europe, loose US laws allow companies to charge significant fees for processing, creating a lucrative market that has led to instances of families being deceived and bodies being mistreated. While proponents argue these brokers fill a critical need for medical and scientific advancement, critics point to a lack of oversight that enables exploitation of grieving families and disrespect for the deceased.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 19:09:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government data from England reveals a strong correlation between school attendance in the first week of term and a student's likelihood of being persistently absent later in the year. According to the figures, over half of pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 went on to miss at least 10% of the school year. In response, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents and schools to prioritize attendance from day one, as educators continue to grapple with higher absenteeism rates since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not be running for a third term in 2026, according to a senior GOP official. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and the first woman from Iowa to do so. Her decision is expected to set off a competitive race for the open seat, with Republican Representative Ashley Hinson reportedly planning to announce her candidacy. Ernst's departure marks the end of a notable tenure in which she held several leadership positions within the Senate Republican conference.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the potential deployment of military forces to Chicago by the Trump administration, labeling the move an "invasion." Pritzker expressed concern that the action is not genuinely about crime reduction but may have ulterior motives, such as disrupting the 2026 elections. The statement highlights the escalating conflict between state and federal authorities over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement, following similar controversial deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</p>

In a world where institutions like the United Nations are often deadlocked, Indonesia's approach as a middle power could provide a practical framework for addressing complex global challenges.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation.

Early reviews are mixed, with some critics praising its epic scale, artistry, and emotional depth, while others found it visually impressive but lacking in substance, suggesting it may not rank among the director's finest works.</p>

However, modern forensic analysis of exhumed remains and crime scene evidence revealed inconsistencies with Pusser's account, including a likely self-inflicted gunshot wound and signs that the scene was staged.

          <p>A shooter identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman opened fire at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, killing two children, ages 8 and 10, and injuring 18 others. The attacker, who was armed with multiple legally purchased firearms, fired through church windows before dying by suicide.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on most countries are illegal, stating he overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The decision invalidates levies on numerous countries but does not affect sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum or those imposed during his first term on China. While the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, this ruling introduces significant uncertainty into the president's aggressive trade agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article synthesizes recommendations from pediatricians, psychologists, and media educators on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that less is generally better, especially in early development. For toddlers, experts suggest a "screen-free until three" approach to encourage exploration of the physical world, while preschoolers should have a maximum of 30 minutes. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication, with parents encouraged to set clear rules and model healthy media habits themselves.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and former Bridgewater strategist Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his push to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could jeopardize the central bank's independence. She argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy and lead to negative long-term economic consequences, including higher inflation, a weaker dollar, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, Patterson believes the damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the US economy.

The call comes amid chaos at the CDC, where its director was recently fired, and growing bipartisan concern over Kennedy's leadership and its potential to reverse decades of progress in combating vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with plans to eliminate over 500 jobs at Voice of America and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media. The move, announced by acting CEO Kari Lake, comes despite a recent federal court order blocking the removal of VOA's director and questioning the administration's compliance with previous rulings. This action intensifies a legal and political battle over the future of the government-funded broadcaster, which critics argue is essential for providing objective news in regions with restricted press freedom.</p>
