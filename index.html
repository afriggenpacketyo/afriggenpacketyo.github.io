          <p>Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge on eggs that it implemented in response to record-high prices caused by an avian flu outbreak.

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, a prominent Pentecostal televangelist who built a global media empire in the 1980s, has passed away at the age of 90. His ministry, which once raised over $100 million annually, was severely damaged by marital infidelity scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990s, leading to his defrocking by the Assemblies of God. Despite the public fall from grace, Swaggart returned to preaching and continued his ministry, including radio and television broadcasts, for the remainder of his life.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates near record highs, many consumers are considering debt forgiveness programs as a potential solution for overwhelming balances. These programs can potentially reduce debt by 30% to 50% for those with significant balances and a demonstrated financial hardship. However, forgiveness is not a universal solution, as it can negatively impact credit scores and may not be suitable for those who can manage repayment through other means. Experts advise carefully weighing this option against alternatives like debt consolidation or credit counseling before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

This low-hanging, tube-shaped cloud formed following a period of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 107Â°F, that gave way to thunderstorms. According to the National Weather Service, these arcus clouds are relatively uncommon and appear to be rolling on a horizontal axis, often associated with thunderstorm activity.

To offset these cuts, the legislation would reduce spending on social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, overhaul student loan borrowing limits, and eliminate clean energy tax credits for consumers.

Both proposals introduce work requirements for beneficiaries and more frequent eligibility checks, but they diverge on issues like provider taxes and specific rules for parental work exemptions.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will lose access to a key satellite data program by July 31, just as the U.S. enters peak hurricane season. The Department of Defense is decommissioning its Meteorological Satellite Program, which has provided crucial environmental data for weather forecasting since the 1960s, citing cybersecurity risks and outdated technology. While NOAA states its remaining data sources are sufficient, some former officials express concern that losing this dataset, especially after recent staff reductions, is ill-timed and could compromise forecasting capabilities.</p>

          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark 1970s environmental law, in an effort to address the state's severe housing shortage.

          <p>For consumers struggling with high-interest credit card debt, consolidation can be an effective strategy, but it requires careful preparation. Before pursuing consolidation, individuals should first calculate their total debt, including all interest rates and fees, to understand the full financial picture. The next step is to thoroughly research and compare all available options, such as personal loans and balance transfer cards, from various lenders like banks and credit unions. Finally, considering a structured debt consolidation program through a reputable relief company might be a beneficial alternative for some borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump visited a new, controversial migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials. The temporary facility, located at a remote airport, is designed to house, process, and deport undocumented immigrants as part of an expanded deportation campaign. During his tour, Trump praised the facility and suggested it could be a model for other states, while officials warned that migrants who do not self-deport could end up there. The project has drawn protests and a lawsuit from environmental groups over its location.</p>

          <h2>Ukraine Strikes Russian Airbase Used as a Fallback Location for Fighter Jets</h2>

          <p>Ukrainian long-range drones successfully struck the Marinovka airbase deep inside Russia, destroying at least two Su-34 fighter-bomber aircraft. According to UK defense intelligence, this base was being used as a dispersal point to protect jets relocated from other, more vulnerable airfields closer to the front lines. The attack demonstrates that even with these protective measures, Russian aviation remains susceptible to Ukrainian strikes. The Su-34 fleet is critical for Russia's use of devastating glide bombs, and Ukraine has made targeting these aircraft a high priority.</p>
