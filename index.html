          <h2>Iranian Parliament Supports Blocking Strait of Hormuz Amid Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 08:08:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Iranian parliament has approved a measure to potentially block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil trade route, following recent strikes by the U.S. on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that risks alienating Tehran's neighbors and trade partners, especially China. Experts suggest that Iran has much to lose by closing the strait, as it relies on it for its own oil exports and risks provoking neighboring oil-producing countries and inviting a strong response from the U.S. Disruptions to the strait could remove over 17 billion barrels of oil from global markets, affecting Asia, Europe, and North America, and severely impacting natural gas flows, particularly from Qatar. China has called on the international community to work toward de-escalation of the Iran crisis, given the mounting risk of a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. The decision to close the waterway now rests with the country's national security council, and its possibility has raised the specter of higher energy prices and aggravated geopolitical tensions, with Washington calling upon Beijing to prevent the strait's closure.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna, have voluntarily agreed to streamline and reduce prior authorizations, a process often criticized for causing care delays and physician burnout. Dozens of plans will implement changes across markets, including commercial coverage and certain Medicare and Medicaid plans, aiming to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce administrative burdens on providers. Prior authorization requires providers to obtain approval from a patient's insurance company before carrying out specific services or treatments, which insurers say ensures medically necessary care and controls costs. The announced changes are expected to benefit 257 million Americans by improving the efficiency and speed of healthcare access.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Science and Technology has directed federal agencies to implement "gold standard science" principles, as outlined in President Trump's executive order, to depoliticize research and restore public trust. These principles emphasize reproducibility, transparency, unbiased peer review, and the absence of conflicts of interest in federally supported research. Agencies have been given 60 days to outline implementation plans, including training and resources for personnel and the use of AI-driven tools. The goal is to ensure that scientific inquiry is strengthened, public trust is rebuilt, and the U.S. remains a global leader in evidence-based science, particularly in addressing complex challenges in energy innovation and national security.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist state politician, has gained significant traction in the New York City mayoral race, challenging frontrunner Andrew Cuomo with his progressive platform and social media savvy. Mamdani's campaign focuses on issues such as rent freezes, free city buses, and increased taxes on corporations and high-income earners. His rise has been fueled by a strong social media presence and endorsements from prominent progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. Despite criticisms regarding his limited political experience, Mamdani has energized young voters and presented a stark contrast to Cuomo, the former New York governor.</p>

While Tesla's Robotaxi is starting in Austin with plans for expansion, Apollo Go already operates in over 15 cities, including Hong Kong, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that precision munitions struck intended targets, but a full damage assessment is ongoing.

          <p>The Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil transport, faces renewed security concerns as Iran threatens to close it in response to recent attacks. China has called for de-escalation, while the US urges China to prevent Iran from closing the strait, highlighting the waterway's strategic importance. The potential closure could disrupt oil supplies, affect energy importers, and trigger military intervention. Gulf Arab nations are seeking alternative routes to bypass the strait, but the majority of crude shipments still rely on this vital passage.</p>

          <p>Shipping groups are increasingly avoiding the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil chokepoint, due to heightened fears of a widening conflict in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The number of vessels navigating the strait has declined, with some shipowners pausing transits and suppliers of LNG advising lifters to wait before entering the Gulf. Japan's Nippon Yusen and Mitsui O.S.K Lines have introduced standby measures to limit time spent in the Persian Gulf, while insurance costs are expected to spike, reflecting the increased risk in the region.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has proposed a plan to allow non-domiciles in the UK to avoid many UK taxes by paying a Â£250,000 fee, with the revenue directed to people on the lowest incomes. Under the plan, non-doms would receive a Britannia Card, exempting them from taxes on wealth, income, and capital gains earned abroad, as well as inheritance tax. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claims this will attract "tens of thousands" of people to the UK. Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves criticized the proposal as a "tax cut for foreign billionaires," suggesting that Reform would need to raise taxes or cut public services to compensate for the lost revenue.

While Beijing has pledged to support Iran's sovereignty, its rhetoric has shifted to brokering dialogue and a ceasefire, avoiding direct condemnation of Israel.

Iran is considering its response to the U.S. attack, with options including cyber attacks and disrupting oil shipping in the Gulf.
