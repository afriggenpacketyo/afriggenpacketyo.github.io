          <h2>US Requested Japan Increase Defense Spending, Potentially Delaying Security Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 07:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly asked Japan to increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its GDP, a request that may lead to the cancellation of a planned high-level meeting between the two countries' foreign and defense chiefs. The increased demand follows Japan's previous commitment in 2022 to double its annual defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027. Trump continues to assert that the U.S.-Japan security treaty is one-sided and seeks increased financial contributions from Tokyo for American troops stationed in Japan once tariff negotiations progress. The meeting's cancellation could strain relations as Japan navigates its defense policy amidst growing regional tensions. The impact of these developments on the U.S.-Japan alliance remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion piece accuses legacy media outlets of bias for not covering a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing investigating former President Joe Biden's mental fitness. The author argues that the broadcast networks prioritize hearings run by Democrats while ignoring those led by Republicans. The article contrasts this with the extensive coverage given to the House Special Committee on the January 6 attack, which the author claims was overly publicized and partisan. The piece concludes that the media's selective coverage underscores why Americans turn to conservative media for a more balanced perspective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines Donald Trump's increasing commercialization of politics, highlighting the launch of Trump-branded products like a "made in America" phone and a patriotically-priced phone plan. Marketing experts note that Trump's business ventures reinforce his political persona, appealing to his supporters as proof of his self-made success and outsider status. The article also points out the blurred lines between business and politics, with Trump's presidency being seen as a brand-franchise. This intertwining of power and profit raises ethical concerns and accelerates the notion of post-ethical politics, although Trump's supporters may not view it as damaging.</p>

          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt's new book, *It's Only Drowning*, explores his unlikely friendship with his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a truck driver and Joe Rogan fan, through surfing. Litt, a Yale-educated liberal, initially struggled to connect with Kappler due to their differing backgrounds and ideologies. However, learning to surf together provided a neutral ground for connection and understanding. Litt reflects on America's deep political and cultural divisions, arguing that shared activities can bridge divides and foster empathy. He suggests focusing on neutral topics rather than contentious political issues to build relationships with those holding different views.</p>

          <p>An NPR article discusses the use of sexual assault as a plot device in Celine Song's film *Materialists*, drawing parallels to a similar plotline in the movie *Showgirls*. The article focuses on how the protagonist, Lucy, finds redemption through a client who has been sexually assaulted by someone Lucy set her up with, leading to questions about the film's marketing as a rom-com. The author argues that while not as exploitative as *Showgirls*, the use of trauma feels cynical and ultimately detracts from the film's overall message. The piece critiques the film's reliance on a retrograde trope to drive the protagonist's emotional growth.</p>

          <p>Tulsi Gabbard now asserts that Iran could produce nuclear weapons within weeks, reversing her earlier testimony before Congress where she stated Iran was not actively building them. This shift follows statements from Donald Trump indicating that intelligence showed Iran had significant material and could develop a nuclear weapon within months. Gabbard's initial testimony, which was criticized by Trump, stated that Iran had a high stockpile of enriched uranium but had not resumed its suspended 2003 nuclear weapons program. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful and denies seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but international concerns remain about its enriched uranium stockpile.</p>

The Federal Reserve's decision to hold off on a rate cut is contributing to the volatility in the market.

Anti-plastic advocates view the water bottle as a symbolic contradiction, given Newsom's past commitments to reducing plastic pollution.

          <p>Two large sculptures, valued at $2.1 million, were stolen from a warehouse in Anaheim Hills, prompting an investigation by police. The sculptures, created by artist Sir Daniel Winn, are titled "Icarus Within" and "Quantum Mechanics: Homme," and weigh thousands of pounds each. Authorities believe the theft occurred over a weekend, with no other items in the warehouse disturbed, leading to speculation about the motive behind the crime. While the artist suspects an unscrupulous collector, an art recovery expert suggests the sculptures may be scrapped for their metal value, highlighting the potential loss of significant artistic works.</p>

          <p>Investigators are exploring potential motives behind the Minnesota rampage that resulted in the death of a state lawmaker and her husband, and the shooting of another legislator and his wife. While initial focus centered on political affiliations, investigators are now examining the suspect's religious background and views on abortion. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, had notebooks containing notes on potential targets, including Democratic officials and abortion rights supporters. Scholars suggest examining the rampage within the context of anti-abortion violence and its ties to conservative Evangelical Christian movements, particularly the New Apostolic Reformation, which uses war-like rhetoric against those supporting abortion rights.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran continues, concerns are rising about Israel's capacity to sustain its air defenses against Iranian missile attacks. The article analyzes the balance between Iran's missile stockpile and Israel's interceptor capabilities, noting that Israel may eventually need to ration its interceptors, potentially prioritizing military targets over civilian infrastructure. Israel claims to control Iranian airspace and is targeting missile launchers to diminish Iran's offensive capabilities. The ongoing conflict is taking a heavy toll on civilians, with casualties reported on both sides, and the situation remains tense as both countries deplete their arsenals.</p>

Critics, including Lord Shinkwin, express concerns that the bill could lead to vulnerable individuals being coerced into ending their lives.

Near-daily patrols, sharply increasing since 2024, aim to exert pressure and demonstrate resolve. Understanding these categories helps decipher China's intentions and messaging regarding Taiwan.</p>

A recent sentencing of a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter in Azerbaijan on charges deemed false has heightened these fears.

          <p>An opinion piece in *The Guardian* explores the nature of feminist critique of celebrities, questioning whether it has devolved into snide and ironically paternalistic tellings-off. The author criticizes the policing of feminine sexuality under the guise of concern for women’s safety, arguing that it restricts women into smaller and smaller boxes. The piece contrasts modern critiques with the rich arguments of the “sex wars” of the 1970s, suggesting that contemporary discourse lacks depth and awareness of economic forces. The article ultimately calls for a more nuanced and historically informed approach to critiquing female celebrities.</p>

          <p>Everton must learn lessons in this pivotal summer for David Moyes & Friedkin Group, following a transfer news report that emphasizes the need for the Toffees to retain key players while strategically recruiting in critical positions. Osman believes Everton must retain key players such as Jarrad Branthwaite, James Tarkowski and Jordan Pickford, while recruiting more leaders to bolster a rapidly thinning squad. The club is interested in Villareal striker Thierno Barry, and Everton has taken steps to streamline their process, moving away from a director-of-football model following the departure of Kevin Thelwell to a sports leadership team headed by new chief executive Angus Kinnear. Osman has backed the new structure to succeed and trusts David Moyes more than anyone.</p>
