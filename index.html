          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he has not yet endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, citing that they do not know each other well and their districts do not overlap. Speaking on ABC's "This Week," Jeffries mentioned he congratulated Mamdani on his primary victory but emphasized the need for a substantive conversation before any endorsement. The article provides context on Mamdani's controversial democratic socialist platform, which includes shifting tax burdens to wealthier neighborhoods and strong anti-Israel positions, highlighting a significant rift within the Democratic party over his candidacy.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned punk duo Bob Vylan for leading chants of "death, death to the IDF" during their Glastonbury Festival performance, labeling it "appalling hate speech." Festival organizers also expressed they were "appalled," stating the chants "very much crossed a line." The BBC, which broadcast the set live, faced significant criticism and announced the performance would not be available on its iPlayer service due to its offensive nature. The incident has prompted police to review the footage for potential criminal offenses and has intensified the debate over political expression at major cultural events.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered Palestinians to evacuate parts of northern Gaza, signaling an expansion of military operations, while U.S. President Donald Trump has renewed calls for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Recent Israeli attacks have resulted in numerous casualties, including children killed in a strike on the al-Mawasi area, which had been designated a safe zone. The article notes that international mediation efforts to end the war have intensified but remain stalled.

          <p>An early morning explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood resulted in the collapse of three rowhomes, killing one person and injuring two others. Officials confirmed that an 82-year-old woman and a 62-year-old woman were hospitalized, one in critical condition. The cause of the blast is under investigation by multiple agencies, including the Philadelphia Fire Department, PGW, and the ATF, in a slow process to prevent further collapses. Nearby residents were evacuated, and the American Red Cross is assisting at least 24 displaced people, with Mayor Cherelle Parker urging public support for the affected families.</p>

Regarding diplomacy, Iravani indicated that the current conditions are not suitable for a new round of negotiations with the U.S. following recent military aggression.

          <p>Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb expressed concern over the Trump administration's new direction on public health, particularly the politicization of immunization policy. He highlighted the recent overhaul of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which saw experienced members replaced with appointees aligned with Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s views. Gottlieb warned that these changes, such as questioning the safety of the flu vaccine ingredient thimerosal, could erode public trust and restrict access to vital vaccines beyond just COVID-19. He fears this political shift will also stifle innovation in vaccine science as investment in the sector pulls back.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that insiders at AI chipmaker Nvidia have sold more than $1 billion of company stock over the past year, with approximately $500 million of those sales occurring in the last month. The selling activity has coincided with the stock reaching new highs, up over 17% this year. CEO Jensen Huang recently sold about $15 million in shares as part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 6 million shares by the end of the year. Despite the significant insider sales, Nvidia's stock continued to rally, briefly regaining its position as the world's most valuable company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States is dangerously dependent on China for rare earth elements, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems like fighter jets and electric vehicles. The author points to China's recent export controls as a sign of its willingness to weaponize this dependency, a vulnerability the U.S. has failed to address for over 15 years. A recent six-month trade deal to resume exports is viewed with skepticism, as it requires U.S. firms to provide sensitive data, amounting to competitive surveillance. The piece calls for a robust, long-term national strategy to build a complete and independent critical minerals supply chain to counter China's geopolitical leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking on "Face the Nation," he criticized the legislation for its projected $3.3 trillion increase to the national deficit over a decade while making cuts to healthcare, nutrition programs, and support for rural hospitals. Warner argued that despite some potentially popular provisions like an expanded Child Tax Credit, the overall negative impacts of the bill would ultimately backfire on Republicans.

Passengers, including the first Nigerian to fly to space, experienced about three minutes of weightlessness and viewed Earth through the capsule's large windows.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary signals a significant shift in the party's politics, particularly among Jewish voters in a city with the world's largest Jewish population outside Israel. Mamdani, an outspoken critic of Israel, defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had centered his campaign on supporting Israel. His success reflects a growing disillusionment among many progressive Democrats, including some Jewish voters, with Israel's actions in Gaza. However, Mamdani's positions have also alarmed others in the Jewish community, who fear for their safety and see his rise as a sign of waning traditional political influence.</p>

The extreme heat is expected to continue, with London forecast to reach 35Â°C, and authorities in Greece have issued new wildfire warnings. Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of these heatwaves to human-driven climate change, warning that societies must adapt to even higher temperatures in the future as these events become more common.</p>

          <p>With heatwaves becoming more common, an article from a BBC correspondent and guide dog handler emphasizes the severe risks of exercising dogs in hot weather. The RSPCA warns that dogs are far more likely to suffer heat-related illness from exercise than from being left in hot cars, as they can only regulate their temperature through panting and their paws. Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, lethargy, and excessive drooling. The article strongly advises owners to avoid walks during the hottest parts of the day, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water, suggesting indoor play as a safe alternative for exercise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that Iran possesses the capability to restart uranium enrichment within a matter of months. His assessment follows a recent U.S. military strike on three of its nuclear facilities. While President Trump claimed the sites were "totally obliterated," a preliminary U.S. intelligence report suggested only limited damage. Grossi noted that Iran's nuclear knowledge and industrial capacity remain intact, and it's possible that enriched uranium was moved to secret locations before the attack. He stressed the importance of resuming discussions and allowing international inspectors back into the country.</p>

The first trial ended in a hung jury and a mistrial in July 2024. The highly publicized retrial, which began in April 2025, culminated in a jury acquitting Read of the most serious charges, including second-degree murder and manslaughter, while convicting her of driving under the influence.</p>

A recent Department of Justice memo argued that Trump has the authority to rescind monument designations, setting up a potential legal battle over the president's power under the Antiquities Act. While the tribe celebrates its hard-won victory, it now braces for another fight to preserve the sacred and ecologically vital landscape.</p>

          <h2>Trump Threatens Primary Challenge Against GOP Senator Thom Tillis for Opposing Spending Bill</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina for his refusal to support the president's major tax and spending package, known as the "big, beautiful bill." In a social media post, Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against Tillis in his 2026 re-election campaign, accusing him of grandstanding. Tillis, one of two Republicans to vote against advancing the bill, cited concerns over cuts to Medicaid that would harm his state's hospitals and rural communities. Despite the opposition, the legislation narrowly passed a key procedural vote in the Senate and is being pushed for final passage.</p>
