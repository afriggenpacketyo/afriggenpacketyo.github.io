Speaking at the Munich Leaders Meeting in Washington, Vance indicated that while Russia is interested in resolving the conflict, the current terms are unacceptable to the Trump administration. Vance emphasized the need for both countries to establish basic guidelines for direct negotiations, with the U.S. willing to participate in these discussions to facilitate progress towards a resolution.
