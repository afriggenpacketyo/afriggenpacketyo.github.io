          <p>The U.S. military has conducted another airstrike in the Caribbean, targeting a vessel alleged to be involved in drug smuggling. For the first time in this series of strikes, a U.S. official confirmed there are survivors, a departure from previous incidents where no survivors were reported. The Trump administration defends these actions as necessary to combat narcoterrorism, citing a decrease in drug-laden boats reaching U.S. shores. Meanwhile, Venezuela's UN ambassador has condemned the strikes, accusing the U.S. of extrajudicial killings and calling for a UN investigation into the operations.</p>

This positive performance stood in contrast to broader market downturns across the Asia-Pacific region. Other major indexes, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei 225, experienced significant losses due to mounting fears about the U.S. banking sector and persistent trade tensions. The decline in other Asian markets followed a sell-off on Wall Street, highlighting investor anxiety. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call where Trump claims 'great progress was made,' shifting focus back to the European conflict after a ceasefire was achieved in Gaza. To increase pressure on Moscow, the White House is considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a possibility that will be discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This renewed diplomatic push signals a significant effort to resolve the nearly four-year-long conflict.</p>

          <p>A long-acting injection to prevent HIV, known as cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales, aligning their policy with Scotland. Administered every two months, this shot provides an alternative to daily oral pills (PrEP), which can be impractical or challenging for some high-risk individuals to take consistently. Health experts and officials have hailed the approval as a 'game-changing' step toward the UK's goal of eliminating new HIV cases by 2030. The new option is expected to improve access and convenience, particularly for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>China's military has initiated training drills in the South China Sea near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, as announced by its Maritime Safety Administration. The timing of these exercises is notable, as they began on the final day of the annual 'Sama Sama' joint naval exercises between the United States and the Philippines. These U.S.-Philippine drills, which also included forces from Japan, Canada, and France, were aimed at enhancing joint maritime defense capabilities. The concurrent military activities highlight the escalating tensions and strategic maneuvering in the resource-rich and contested waterway.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the political climate under President Trump is fostering an 'anti-truth crusade' that threatens the foundational principles of the Enlightenment. The author points to the administration's supporters who dismiss inconvenient evidence as 'bias' and highlights recent decisions by tech giants like Meta and Google to replace professional fact-checkers with 'community notes' systems. This shift, the article argues, abandons objective, evidence-based truth in favor of a consensus-driven reality, potentially allowing misinformation to flourish. The piece frames independent fact-checking organizations as a crucial frontline in defending reason against this trend.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced a significant downturn, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling by 1.5% in early trading.

Major indexes in the U.K., France, and Germany all registered losses, reflecting widespread investor anxiety. Additionally, defense stocks fell after the announcement of a planned meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine.

          <p>A federal appeals court has refused the Trump administration's request to lift an order preventing the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois. The three-judge panel determined that the administration was unlikely to prove a 'rebellion' exists in the state, which is a legal requirement for such a federal intervention. The court found insufficient evidence that protests against federal immigration policies have impeded law enforcement or amounted to an insurrection. This decision keeps a temporary restraining order in place, maintaining the state's control over the troops and representing a check on presidential power.</p>

Researchers found that the city is sinking, a common issue for delta cities built on soft sediment, while global sea levels are rising at a rate unprecedented in the last four millennia. The analysis attributes at least 94 percent of this rapid urban subsidence to human activities. This combination of sinking land and rising waters significantly increases the risk of flooding for the major coastal metropolis and other similar cities.</p>

          <h2>Wayne Rooney Questions Marcus Rashford's Claim of an 'Inconsistent Environment' at Manchester United</h2>

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has expressed skepticism about Marcus Rashford's recent comments blaming an 'inconsistent environment' for his struggles at the club. Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona, had a standout 2022-23 season but saw his form decline afterward. Rooney, speaking on his podcast, suggested that blaming the environment can be an easy excuse for a player's own lack of application. He argued that a player's effort level, such as running more during games, is a matter of personal responsibility and is not determined by the surrounding environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union leaders are set to call for accelerated proposals on using frozen Russian sovereign assets to provide financial support for Ukraine, according to a draft document. The move comes amid increasing pressure from the U.S. to seize the assets, which total about €175 billion in cash from matured holdings in Europe. While the EU has been using the profits from these assets to aid Kyiv, concerns over legal and financial repercussions have slowed further action. The document emphasizes the need for fair burden-sharing with G7 partners to address Ukraine's pressing financial needs for 2026-2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Venezuela's ambassador to the United Nations, Samuel Moncada, has strongly condemned a series of recent U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean, labeling them 'extrajudicial executions.' He urged the UN Security Council to investigate the attacks, which U.S. officials claim target suspected drug traffickers but which Venezuela alleges hit civilian vessels in international waters. Moncada highlighted that there have been five lethal attacks resulting in 27 reported deaths since September. The diplomatic plea comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Caracas, with the U.S. holding veto power on the Security Council.</p>

          <p>Daniel Duggan, a former U.S. Marine Corps pilot, is appealing his extradition from Australia to the United States, where he faces charges for allegedly training Chinese military pilots over a decade ago. A 2016 U.S. indictment accuses Duggan of conspiring to provide training in 2010 and 2012 without the required license. Duggan, who denies the allegations, has been held in a maximum-security prison since his 2022 arrest. His lawyers argue there were legal flaws in the extradition process, while his wife contends he is a pawn in the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Japan's increasingly fragmented and turbulent political landscape could undermine its diplomatic commitments, particularly regarding the trilateral relationship with China and South Korea, according to political analysts. The current instability, highlighted by the LDP's struggle to secure a majority for its prime ministerial candidate, suggests that any future government will likely be unstable. This lack of a strong, unified government could hinder Japan's ability to engage effectively in major diplomatic initiatives and may stall momentum on resolving long-standing issues within the trilateral framework with its key regional neighbors.</p>

The hardest-hit villages, Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, saw homes washed away and are now contaminated with leaked fuel, making them uninhabitable.

          <p>The UK government is rolling out a digital identity card for military veterans, which can be downloaded to a smartphone. This initiative, available to approximately 1.8 million former service members, is designed to make it easier for them to prove their status and access dedicated services like healthcare, housing support, and retail discounts. Ministers also see the launch as a case study to demonstrate the functionality and security of a planned, more comprehensive digital ID scheme for all UK citizens and residents. The veteran card is optional but marks a key step in the government's broader digital identity strategy.</p>

          <p>Fans of the Israeli football club Maccabi Tel Aviv have been barred from attending their upcoming Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham.

Police cited intelligence and past incidents, including violent clashes during a 2024 match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax in Amsterdam that were linked to the Middle East crisis.
