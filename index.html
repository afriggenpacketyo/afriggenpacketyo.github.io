          <p>President Trump's plan for a second-term agenda, dubbed the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' faces challenges due to disagreements over the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to itemize state and local taxes, benefiting residents in high-tax states like New York and California. While Trump initially capped the SALT deduction at $10,000 in 2017, he later pledged to end the cap during his 2024 campaign. However, Republican hardliners are pushing back against raising the SALT cap, leading to infighting within the party and threatening the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is facing criticism after a federal judge ordered officials to keep custody of migrants reportedly flown on a deportation flight to South Sudan. DHS maintains that South Sudan is not the migrants' final destination, asserting that the individuals are "uniquely barbaric monsters" convicted of serious crimes, including murder and sexual assault. The judge's order requires that illegal migrants have a "meaningful opportunity" to challenge their removal to countries other than their homelands.

Investors are anticipating regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to further drive bitcoin prices higher.

          <p>Tax cuts pushed by President Trump are amplifying debt and deficit concerns among the powerful market players who influence interest rates. The bond market, already on edge over President Trump’s whipsawing tariff policy, showed fresh nervousness this week over the tax bill. Since dropping below 4 percent in early April, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen back above 4.5 percent, a large move reflecting deficit worries. Some investors are skeptical, especially if the Republican-controlled Congress does not make substantive changes to the current bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican holdouts on Wednesday afternoon as negotiations over the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act" falter. The meeting comes as GOP leaders scramble to get the bill back on track after negotiations went south with hard-liners overnight. The GOP is far from unified around the bill with several sticking points among Republican hard-liners primarily regarding Medicaid work requirements and a cap on state and local tax deductions.</p>
