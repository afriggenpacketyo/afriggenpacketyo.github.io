          <p>President Trump can continue collecting import taxes for now, after an appeals court temporarily suspended a lower court's order that deemed his global tariffs illegal. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened trade negotiations. The White House has suspended or revised many duties during trade negotiations, but the appeals court decision allows the tariffs to be used for now while the case is litigated. The next hearing is scheduled for June 5. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is expected to resume on June 7 after crews spent nearly six weeks reinforcing tracks that were subject to landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction, placing thousands of tons of boulders and cubic yards of sand along the rail line. A 1,400-foot-long catchment is also being constructed beside the rail. The OCTA acknowledged recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs.</p>
