          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of fighting that included Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear program and subsequent U.S. attacks. The announcement followed an Iranian missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which caused no casualties. This attack was in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop bunker-buster bombs on Iranian nuclear sites, causing monumental damage according to Trump, though a full assessment is pending. The ceasefire aims to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East. The overall stability is questionable given the prior exchanges. Optimism for peace is moderate, considering the history of conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of students enrolled in Japanese schools in China has declined by over 10% in the academic year starting April, marking a concerning trend. This decrease is attributed to an economic slump in China and growing safety concerns among Japanese expatriate communities, particularly after a knife attack near Shanghai and the fatal stabbing of a Japanese boy in Shenzhen. Security measures have been increased at Japanese schools, but parents remain vigilant. Fears of worsening public sentiment toward Japanese nationals also contribute to the decline, especially with the upcoming release of a movie featuring the Imperial Japanese Army's Unit 731. The overall environment is creating unease for Japanese families living in China.</p>

          <p>Thailand has banned tourists from entering Cambodia due to a persistent border dispute and concerns about illegal scam operations. The restrictions apply to all travelers crossing into Cambodia from Thai checkpoints and foreign tourists flying into Siem Reap. This action follows heightened tensions between the two countries, including armed clashes and punitive measures such as import bans on various goods. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has vowed to crack down on scam operations in Cambodia, including suspending internet services used by Cambodian security agencies.

Potential changes could include choice screens for users to access different search providers and increased transparency for publishers. Google has expressed concerns about the potential implications of these changes. The investigation aims to promote a more open, competitive, and innovative online search market in the UK.</p>

The article also discusses NATO's open-door policy and the aspirations of countries like Ukraine to join the alliance.

The conflict is forcing most carriers to avoid flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes.

This situation may widen the competitive gap that Chinese airlines already have over others. The restrictions and diversions are impacting flight times and airfares.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the timeline of the 2018 murder case of Blaze Bernstein, from his disappearance to the conviction of Sam Woodward. Blaze went missing while visiting family, and his body was later found buried in a shallow grave. Woodward, a former classmate, was arrested and charged with murder, with a hate crime enhancement added later. The trial included testimony from Bernstein's parents and Woodward himself, who claimed he was provoked by Bernstein. Woodward was ultimately found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>
