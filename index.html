        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has successfully cultivated a relationship with President Trump, leading to a new trade agreement between the UK and the US. The details of the agreement, announced by Mr. Trump on social media, are still emerging, but it is expected to significantly strengthen ties between the two nations. While the deal could face scrutiny from British farmers concerned about American imports, it marks a political win for Starmer, who has acted as a bridge between Europe and the US and has avoided criticizing Trump. The agreement is seen as a symbol of enduring ties between Britain and the United States.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Chris Murphy discusses the Democratic Party's response to Donald Trump's second term, arguing the party was unprepared for Trump's coordinated assault on the rule of law. Murphy suggests Democrats need to match Trump's content output, engage in more risk-tolerant tactics, and focus on unrigging democracy through campaign finance reform and ethics legislation. He emphasizes the need for Democrats to credibly argue against Trump's destruction of democracy by demonstrating a commitment to fixing the system, also highlighting the importance of addressing economic unfairness to resonate with voters. He feels Democrats must be more willing to name individuals, organizations, and companies that are 'screwing voters'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump briefly floated the idea of imposing a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America, causing concern in Hollywood. The proposal, later walked back by the White House, aimed to address the industry's challenges, including fewer movies being made in Los Angeles due to cheaper labor and tax incentives overseas. While Hollywood enjoys a trade surplus, Trump's suggestion highlighted the ongoing debate over how to bolster American film production, with some advocating for tax credits instead of tariffs. The article also touches on broader economic issues, including trade tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady amidst tariff uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Governor Kathy Hochul is under fire for supporting changes to a century-old law requiring private schools in New York to provide a basic education. Critics argue that Hochul is seeking political support from Hasidic Jewish leaders, whose schools would be most affected by the changes, at the expense of children's education. The legislation would delay consequences for non-compliant schools and ease compliance requirements. Supporters claim it offers religious schools more flexibility, while opponents fear it will undermine educational standards, particularly in Hasidic yeshivas, which often lack robust secular education despite receiving taxpayer funding.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain are anticipated to announce a trade deal, potentially easing the impact of President Trump's tariffs and providing a political boost to Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The U.S. seeks greater access to the British market for agricultural products, though the UK government remains committed to maintaining its food standards. The deal is viewed as symbolically important, though it may not significantly address the broader trade deficit concerns driving Trump's protectionist policies.</p>
