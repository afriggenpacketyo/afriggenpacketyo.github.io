          <p>A fireworks display at the Rheinkirmes fair in Düsseldorf, Germany, resulted in injuries to 19 people, four of them seriously, after pyrotechnics reportedly misfired and exploded too close to the ground. Eyewitnesses described rockets flying sideways and detonating low, prompting organizers to end the event early to prevent panic. The article also notes a separate warning from the German Red Cross about the public's lack of preparedness for major emergencies.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Environment Agency reveals that serious pollution incidents caused by water companies in England jumped by 60% in 2024, reaching a record high. A cross-party parliamentary committee has labeled the situation a "national disgrace," attributing the problem to years of underinvestment in infrastructure and weak regulatory oversight. While the industry cites a need for increased funding, critics contend that companies have prioritized profits over their environmental responsibilities.</p>

          <p>A recent state audit has determined that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is severely understaffed, compromising its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. The report highlighted a high vacancy rate that has led to failures in conducting timely inspections and properly investigating workplace hazards. Although the agency reports recent improvements in hiring, safety advocates insist that chronic understaffing remains a critical and unresolved issue.</p>
