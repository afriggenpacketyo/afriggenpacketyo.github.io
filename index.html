          <p>New home prices in China's 70 major cities fell by 0.3% in July, marking a continued slide despite government efforts to stabilize the market. This decline matches the previous month's drop, which was the steepest since October of the prior year. While major cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen saw prices fall, Shanghai bucked the trend with a slight increase. These figures suggest that stimulus measures, such as relaxed purchasing restrictions and mortgage rate cuts, have not yet restored buyer confidence in the struggling property sector.

          <p>Following a successful title-winning season, Liverpool's significant summer spending, potentially exceeding £300 million on new talent, has dramatically increased the pressure on manager Arne Slot. Having previously worked with a more limited budget, Slot now leads a revamped squad that is favored to retain the Premier League title. The article explores how this lavish expenditure shifts expectations from a transitional period to a demand for immediate and sustained success, including challenges for both the league and Champions League. Experts suggest Slot's calm demeanor will be crucial in managing the integration of new players and the heightened scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has stated that it will be difficult for striker Alexander Isak to remain at Newcastle United following a rejected £110 million offer from Liverpool. Rooney suggests that while losing Isak would be a significant blow to Newcastle's ambitions, selling him could provide necessary funds to strengthen the overall squad under current financial regulations. For Isak, the potential move to the Premier League champions represents a major career opportunity. The article also includes Rooney's analysis of other key summer transfers, including Benjamin Sesko to Manchester United and Jack Grealish's loan to Everton.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is now offering commercial trips to Mars, with Italy's space agency, ASI, becoming the first customer to book a flight for scientific payloads. The agreement will see Italian experiments, including a plant growth study and a radiation sensor, sent to the red planet. However, no specific timeline has been announced for these missions. The venture faces significant hurdles, as SpaceX's Starship rocket, essential for Mars travel, has experienced multiple test flight failures and is not yet rated for crewed missions. Elon Musk has adjusted his own timeline, suggesting an uncrewed flight is more likely in about 3.5 years.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued a historic advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal obligation to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling, described as the most significant climate development since the 2015 Paris Agreement, suggests that fossil fuel production, including licensing and subsidies, could be considered an internationally wrongful act. According to some financial experts, this non-binding opinion necessitates a revaluation of assets tied to the fossil fuel industry, as prudent investors must now anticipate that governments and courts may act on this legal guidance, creating significant financial and litigation risks.

The deployment aims to help the Haitian government reclaim territory controlled by powerful gangs and advise on restoring revenue collection. This move comes as a UN-backed Kenyan police mission struggles with understaffing and funding shortages. The use of a private military company has raised concerns about sovereignty and the potential for fragmented authority in the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>The upcoming peace summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will address several critical issues to end the war in Ukraine. Key topics include territorial disputes, with Russia demanding formal recognition of occupied lands, which Kyiv opposes. Security guarantees are another major point of contention, as Russia seeks a neutral Ukraine while Kyiv desires closer ties with the West. The discussion will also cover the potential lifting of economic sanctions on Moscow, as well as complex matters like war crimes reparations, prisoner exchanges, and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives in Washington, D.C., that limited cooperation between the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and federal immigration agents.

The move is part of President Trump's broader anti-crime initiative in the capital, which placed the MPD under temporary federal control.

          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key data for retail sales, industrial output, and fixed-asset investment all missed forecasts. Retail sales grew by 3.7%, slowing from the previous month and falling short of expectations, indicating weak domestic demand. Industrial output also recorded its weakest growth since November, while property investment continued to contract significantly. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed the slowdown to a challenging external environment and extreme weather events, raising concerns that China may struggle to meet its annual growth target of 5% without additional policy support.

The White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise," and Trump himself has acknowledged there is a chance it may not succeed.

          <p>Recent research highlights a growing epidemic of loneliness among young men, with a significant decline in the number of close friends they report having since 1990. This social isolation contributes to broader societal issues, including the rise of misogynistic beliefs within the "man box" and the emotional burden placed on female partners. The article argues that men must take responsibility for fostering deeper, more emotionally open friendships and move beyond an identity grounded in domination. It suggests that teaching emotional literacy in schools and creating more positive male role models in pop culture could help create healthier scripts for masculinity.</p>

He pointed out that parties with fewer votes and MPs, such as the Green Party and Plaid Cymru, currently have members in the Lords.

As an experienced negotiator, Putin is expected to be deeply familiar with the details of the Ukraine conflict, in contrast to Trump. His strategy will likely involve appealing to Trump's transactional nature and his desire for a quick, high-profile resolution. Putin may offer apparent concessions, such as a potential meeting with President Zelenskyy or a new nuclear arms control pact, to make Trump feel he is securing a victory while guiding the outcome toward Russia's long-term interests.</p>

          <p>A man was struck and killed by a vehicle on a freeway in Monrovia, a suburb of Los Angeles, while attempting to flee an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid. The incident occurred near a Home Depot, a site where day laborers often gather for work and one of several targeted in recent operations. The man's death has intensified criticism of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, which critics argue instill fear and create dangerous situations. Local officials have expressed condolences and highlighted the tragic human cost of such raids.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota man accused of murdering one state politician and wounding another while disguised as a police officer is now facing upgraded state charges. A new indictment charges Vance Boelter with two counts of first-degree murder and four counts of attempted first-degree murder. This is in addition to a separate federal case where he faces six counts that could carry the death penalty. Authorities allege Boelter used a vehicle resembling a squad car and wore a mask to approach the homes of Representative Melissa Hortman and Senator John Hoffman, where he opened fire.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump made false claims about crime rates in Washington, D.C., stating it is "the worst it’s ever been" as his administration's federal takeover of the city's police unfolds. In reality, violent crime in the district hit a 30-year low in 2024. The comments came as National Guard troops were deployed and federal agents established checkpoints, leading to protests. Concurrently, the administration has begun clearing homeless encampments, a long-standing focus for Trump. The federal intervention has escalated with the appointment of the DEA head as the city's "emergency police commissioner," a move local leaders call unlawful.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling flights as a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants looms, threatening to ground the nation's largest airline and affect 130,000 travelers daily. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations with the airline reached an impasse, with the airline responding with a lockout notice. The main points of contention are wages and compensation for unpaid time when planes are not in the air. The airline has begun a gradual suspension of operations, starting with long-haul overseas flights, and expects to be fully grounded by Saturday morning if no deal is reached.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that state Democrats will advance a plan to redraw congressional maps, directly countering a Republican-led effort in Texas to create more GOP-friendly districts. The proposed "election rigging response act" would override California's independent redistricting commission and would only take effect if Texas or another state implements a partisan mid-cycle gerrymander. Newsom framed the move as a necessary defense of democracy, stating California would not "unilaterally disarm" in what is becoming a national redistricting "arms race." The plan will be put to voters in a special election on November 4th.</p>

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending that the article argues is more true to the spirit of the original "Sex and the City." After the death of her husband and a failed rekindling of a past romance, Carrie embraces a future that may not include another great love. This resolution is seen as a correction to the original series' finale, which provided conventional romantic pairings for all its characters. The article suggests that by ending with Carrie alone but supported by her friends, the show finally honors its core message: that female friendship is the most powerful and enduring relationship of all.</p>

          <p>Shares of Guangzhou Innogen Pharmaceutical Group nearly quadrupled in value during their Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting strong investor confidence in China's biotech sector. The company, which specializes in metabolic drugs, saw its stock price open at HK$72, far above its initial offering price of HK$18.68. This successful IPO is part of a broader trend, with major biotech companies in Hong Kong experiencing significant valuation growth this year. The high demand for Innogen is partly driven by the immense commercial opportunities for its anti-obesity and metabolic treatments in a market with significant unmet clinical needs.

In an interview, Boyadzhyan described the disruptive behavior as a "cry for help," alluding to personal and legal issues that cost him his job.

Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, who was set to begin his senior year at Reseda Charter High School, is being held for overstaying his visa. The incident has heightened fears within the Los Angeles Unified School District, which has seen increased immigration enforcement activity near its schools. District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho criticized the conditions of the student's detention and called for limits on enforcement actions near schools, arguing they create a climate of fear that disrupts education.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a development that could effectively turn any warship into an aircraft carrier. The uncrewed aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of vessels like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, before transitioning to fast, long-range flight. According to the project team, the drone's performance, particularly its speed, is far superior to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in use. This technological advancement could significantly expand the operational range and surveillance power of the Chinese navy by decentralizing its aerial assets.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has dismissed concerns about Latin American countries, including Brazil, increasing their coordination with China in response to U.S. trade policies. When asked about this shift, Trump asserted that the U.S. economy is "blowing everyone away, including China," and that none of the other nations are performing well economically. His comments follow Washington's imposition of a 50% tariff on a wide range of Brazilian exports, a move that prompted Brazil to work more closely with Beijing on a multilateral response. The remarks underscore the administration's confidence in its economic strategy despite signs of shifting geopolitical alliances.</p>
