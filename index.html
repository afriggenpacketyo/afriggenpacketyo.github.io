          <p>Former President Donald Trump made unsubstantiated claims linking Tylenol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy to autism, advising against its prescription. Medical organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly refuted this, stating the claim is not supported by the full body of scientific evidence and could be dangerous. While the FDA advised doctors to consider limiting its use, it also affirmed Tylenol remains the safest over-the-counter option for treating fever and pain in pregnant women, which can also pose health risks. The manufacturer Kenvue and autism advocacy groups have also criticized the president's remarks as irresponsible and lacking scientific basis.</p>

          <p>The military juntas governing Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger have jointly announced their immediate withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), denouncing it as an "instrument of neo-colonialist repression." The three nations, which have formed the Confederation of Sahel States, stated they would no longer recognize the court's authority and accused it of an anti-African bias. This coordinated move follows their earlier withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS and reflects their increasing alignment with Russia and isolation from Western powers. The decision comes as their own armies face accusations of crimes against civilians amid escalating regional violence.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong, Macau, and China's Guangdong Province are preparing for Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the region's strongest storms in years, leading to the closure of schools, businesses, and cancellation of hundreds of flights. The typhoon has already caused at least three fatalities and displaced thousands in the Philippines due to flooding and landslides. Chinese authorities in Shenzhen have ordered the evacuation of 400,000 residents, warning of severe winds and a major storm surge. Macau has ordered all its casinos to close as a precaution, while residents across the region stock up on essential supplies in anticipation of the storm's impact.</p>

          <p>This article explores the significant challenge the United States faces in reviving its shipbuilding industry, which has been overshadowed by the dominance of East Asian nations like China, Japan, and South Korea. China's shipbuilding capacity is estimated to be 200 times larger than that of the U.S., accounting for over half of global new deliveries. The Trump administration has sought investment from Japan and South Korea to bolster American shipbuilding while imposing steep port fees on Chinese-linked ships. The piece questions the consistency of U.S. trade policy, which simultaneously seeks large Boeing jet orders from China while penalizing its maritime industry, highlighting the complexities of industrial policy.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Propose New Theory on the Origin of Giant Exploding Craters in Siberia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 04:25:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have presented a new theory explaining the formation of giant gas emission craters (GECs) in Western Siberia, a mystery that has persisted for over a decade. The study suggests these craters form from a combination of deep underground heat and gas rising to the surface, which thins the permafrost seal from below. This internal pressure, combined with accelerated surface thawing due to climate change, leads to an explosive collapse of the ground. This model aims to explain why these massive craters, which can be over 160 feet deep, have only been observed in the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas, areas with vast natural gas reserves.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Community Debunks Singular Cause for Autism Amid Political Claims</h2>

          <p>This article delves into the scientific consensus on autism, countering President Trump's claim linking it to Tylenol by explaining that there is no single cause for the neurodevelopmental disorder. Experts state that autism is linked to polygenetic risks, involving hundreds or thousands of gene variants, rather than a single medication or factor. The rising number of diagnoses is largely attributed to increased awareness, changes in diagnostic criteria, and better screening methods, particularly for girls. The article also reaffirms that extensive research has repeatedly and vigorously disproven any causal link between vaccines and autism, a theory previously promoted by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive free trade pact after more than nine years of negotiations, a process reportedly accelerated by US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies. The deal will eliminate most tariffs on EU exports like car parts and agricultural goods while opening up investment opportunities in sectors such as electric vehicles. For Indonesia, about 80% of its exports to the EU, including palm oil and textiles, will become tariff-free. The agreement is the EU's third with a Southeast Asian nation and is expected to come into force by 2027 after ratification by all member states.</p>

The broader market gains in Europe were partly fueled by news of a partnership between Nvidia and OpenAI, which boosted technology and semiconductor stocks. Kingfisher's strong performance stands out as a significant positive signal for the retail sector amid otherwise mixed economic data across the continent. (not investment advice)</p>

Her family hopes the guidance will help prevent similar tragedies by encouraging doctors to order more tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists sooner.

It credits captain Tony Jacklin with transforming the European team's fortunes by demanding better resources, professional treatment, and successfully convincing a reluctant Severiano Ballesteros to rejoin the squad. After a narrow loss in 1983, Jacklin's revitalized team secured a decisive win at The Belfry in 1985, ending a 28-year unbeaten streak for the US. This victory is credited with resurrecting the Ryder Cup's competitive spirit and setting the stage for its modern-day global prestige.</p>

          <p>Struggling Chinese property developer Seazen Group is seeking to raise more funds in the offshore dollar bond market, signaling a potential reopening of financing channels for the beleaguered sector. The company is marketing a two-year dollar note, its second such offering in recent months, after being one of the first major private developers to test the market since 2023. This move is part of a broader trend, with corporate issuers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau selling approximately $80 billion in dollar notes so far in 2025, a 21% increase from the previous year, as they seek to refinance debt on more favorable terms.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially designating the left-wing Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization. The order cites a "pattern of political violence" and directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle what it calls a "militarist, anarchist enterprise." The move comes in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, for which Trump has blamed left-wing rhetoric, although investigators have not linked the suspect to any specific groups. Critics and legal experts have raised concerns that the designation could be used to curb free speech and target political opponents, noting there is no legal precedent for labeling a domestic group in this manner.</p>

The article follows the story of a fan from South Korea who paid £900 for a Tottenham ticket, only to be denied entry at the stadium. Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. is attempting to combat the issue by using new technology to detect and cancel tickets bought by touts, blocking hundreds of such transactions for a single match. Football authorities are introducing new rules for digital ticketing, but supporters' groups warn that the problem of touting is becoming endemic across the game.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which had been frozen over allegations of civil rights violations. The judge ruled that the administration likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide specific explanations for the funding cuts. This decision concerns hundreds of critical medical research grants from the National Institutes of Health for studies on conditions like Parkinson's disease and cancer. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's strategy of using federal funding as leverage to push for reforms at elite universities.</p>

          <p>This article explores how modern football tactics, such as an increased focus on set-pieces and direct, long-ball play, are reminiscent of the style famously employed by manager Sam Allardyce. Allardyce, who was often criticized for his pragmatic approach, notes that many top clubs are now adopting strategies he pioneered years ago, including using data analytics and having coaches observe from the stands. The piece highlights a shift away from a possession-based philosophy toward a more direct style that utilizes tall, physical strikers. It suggests that coaches are becoming less fearful of deviating from the prevailing tactical trends in search of a competitive edge.</p>

Russian forces, now controlling about 70% of the area, are pressuring Ukraine's defensive "fortress belt" of four key cities. Analysts and Ukrainian officers report that Russia is using infiltration tactics and heavy bombardment with drones and glide bombs to avoid costly urban assaults, instead aiming to encircle the cities and sever supply lines. Ukrainian forces are facing the grinding reality of troop shortages and exhaustion, which could weaken their ability to resist the relentless Russian pressure.</p>
