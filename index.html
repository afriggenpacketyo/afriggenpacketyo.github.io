          <p>England manager Sarina Wiegman announced the Lionesses will no longer take the knee before matches, stating the anti-racism gesture's impact is "not good enough." The decision follows racist abuse directed at defender Jess Carter and aims to spark a new conversation about tackling racism more effectively. The team will stand at kick-off instead, a move they hope will signal that current efforts are insufficient. The UK's Culture, Media and Sport Secretary acknowledged the societal issue and the limits of legislation alone.</p>

          <p>Approximately 5 million above-ground pools from manufacturers Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup are being recalled following the deaths of nine children. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission identified a drowning hazard where the pools' external compression straps can be used as footholds by young children to climb in. The recall affects pools 48 inches or taller sold since 2002 at major retailers. The companies are offering a free repair kit to secure the pools and eliminate the hazard.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona marks a sad end to his long career at Manchester United, leaving many questions about the breakdown in the relationship. While the deal is financially sensible for Barcelona, Rashford's exit from his boyhood club points to deep-seated issues, with speculation about mismanagement, a loss of desire, or a clash with new manager Ruben Amorim. The article notes that while the player needed a fresh start, the departure of an academy graduate who was once a club icon feels like a failure for both sides.</p>

The author praises their unequivocal "yes" when asked if denying the Jewish people's right to self-determination is antisemitic. The piece contends this clarity helps distinguish legitimate criticism of Israeli policy from anti-Zionism that singles out the Jewish state for elimination. The author suggests this recognition can foster more productive debate on campus by moving past litmus tests over Israel's right to exist.</p>

The process involves multiple officers, or "missileers," across at least two separate bunkers turning keys and levers in unison after decrypting and verifying launch orders. This highly structured protocol is designed to prevent any single individual or crew from initiating a launch or preventing a legitimate one.</p>
