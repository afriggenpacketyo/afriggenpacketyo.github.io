The company also detailed significant investments from the U.S. government, now its top shareholder, and Nvidia, aiming to integrate CPUs with AI graphics processors. Despite a per-share loss due to accounting for government shares and a slight decline in data center CPU sales, Intel expects demand to outpace supply into next year. The article highlights Intel's strategic moves to revive growth and advance its foundry business, including starting production of advanced chips in Arizona.

          <p>Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears criticized state Democrats for planning a special legislative session on redistricting, calling it a 'desperate political stunt' to disrupt her campaign. Democrats reportedly aim to bypass the statutory redistricting commission, potentially through a constitutional amendment, to expand their legislative majority. Sears' campaign spokesperson accused Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger of involvement in these 'Washington-style dirty tricks.' The article notes that while Sears trails Spanberger in polls, other Republican candidates are competitive, highlighting the intense political maneuvering ahead of upcoming elections and the contentious nature of redistricting efforts. This political clash underscores deep partisan divisions in Virginia.</p>

          <p>Meta is laying off an unspecified number of employees in its risk organization as it transitions to using artificial intelligence to automate FTC-mandated privacy compliance reviews. This move is part of broader company restructurings, including recent cuts in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit. The risk organization, formed after a $5 billion FTC fine related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, is tasked with ensuring regulatory compliance. A Meta spokesperson clarified that the revamped system uses basic automation to apply rules, reducing human error and speeding up processes, rather than advanced generative AI. This strategic shift aims to innovate faster while maintaining high compliance standards, despite the job reductions.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor exceeded third-quarter earnings expectations but reduced its 2025 guidance, citing a $1.5 billion to $2 billion impact from a supplier fire disrupting production of profitable trucks and SUVs. The company plans to mitigate these costs by significantly increasing U.S. pickup truck production and adding 1,000 workers by early next year. CEO Jim Farley stated intensive efforts are underway to restore supplies and production, with the impacted plant section expected to restart by early December. The article also notes that changes by the Trump administration to tariffs reduced Ford's expected tariff costs by $1 billion, partially offsetting the fire's financial blow. Ford's strategic plan, Ford+, continues to aim for cost reductions and improved efficiency.</p>

Starbucks Workers United, representing 12,000 employees across 550 cafes, seeks increased hours, higher take-home pay, and resolution of alleged union-busting charges. The union claims Starbucks has refused to offer a new proposal meeting workers' demands, while Starbucks asserts the union walked away from the bargaining table. This potential strike would be the third major national action this year, underscoring persistent labor disputes despite Starbucks' claims of competitive pay and benefits.

          <p>The White House East Wing has been almost entirely demolished to make way for President Donald Trump's controversial $300 million ballroom, an administration official confirmed. Satellite images show the structure reduced to rubble. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the demolition, stating it was necessary for a 'modern and beautiful' structure, despite Trump's earlier promise that the project would not interfere with the existing building. The project is reportedly funded by Trump himself and private corporate donors, including major tech companies. The article highlights public backlash and questions regarding the lack of transparency and approval processes for the demolition of a historic structure. This development underscores the President's personal influence over White House renovations.</p>

          <h2>California Voters Divided on Newsom and Harris Presidential Bids, Poll Reveals</h2>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll indicates mixed opinions among California voters regarding potential 2028 presidential runs by Governor Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris. While Newsom enjoys a positive overall approval rating as governor and stronger support for a presidential bid among Democrats and independents, Harris garners less enthusiasm, even after winning her home state in 2024. The article highlights that Californians believe their state sets a good example in technology, culture, and environmental policy, but performs poorly in housing, tax, and economic policies. This nuanced view reflects voter concerns about the cost of living and skepticism towards both major parties. The poll suggests the 2026 gubernatorial race is still taking shape, with many voters undecided.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have continued their downward trend, with the average 30-year rate reaching 6.19%, near a three-year low. This article advises homebuyers to consider acting now, as future rate drops are expected to be gradual and rates could potentially reverse course. It emphasizes that while current rates are still higher than earlier in the decade, the present market may offer less competition than the traditional spring homebuying season. Homebuyers are encouraged to evaluate their financial situation carefully and not delay in anticipation of major, rapid declines. (not investment advice)</p>

It emphasizes that flexibility and a strategic approach are key to benefiting from both upward and downward movements. Investors should consider premiums, storage, and security for physical holdings.

          <p>Shares in quantum computing companies like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum remained comfortably higher despite the Trump administration denying 'current' talks for equity stakes. The Commerce Department's statement, however, left room for investor optimism regarding potential future deals or alternative funding structures, such as warrants. Quantum firms, which have minimal revenue and are burning cash to develop technology not yet commercially scalable, are actively engaging with the U.S. government for funding opportunities. The article highlights the U.S. government's view of quantum computing as critical for national security and staying ahead of China, even as hyperscalers like Google and IBM make significant breakthroughs. This reflects ongoing interest in a cutting-edge technology sector.</p>

          <p>Several states are warning millions of struggling Americans who rely on SNAP (food stamps) that their benefits may be delayed or halted in November if the federal government shutdown persists. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees the program, indicated 'insufficient funds' for full November payments if appropriations lapse. Advocates and recipients express grave concerns about potential food insecurity, urging the USDA to utilize multiyear contingency funds, as was done in previous shutdowns. The article highlights that the USDA has advised states to pause sending electronic files for benefits, creating uncertainty for over 40 million beneficiaries. This situation underscores the critical impact of political stalemates on vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The belated September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, scheduled for release Friday, is anticipated to reveal a 3.1% annual inflation rate, the highest in 16 months. Economists attribute this increase partly to the Trump administration's tariffs, with companies passing on costs to consumers. The report's release was delayed due to the government shutdown but is crucial for determining the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), also announced Friday. A 2.7% COLA is expected, but advocates worry retirees could face financial strain if prices continue to climb. Despite the recent uptick, the Federal Reserve and most economists predict inflation will ease next year. This article underscores the significant economic implications of the inflation data.</p>

          <p>An article decodes common, often confounding, toddler behaviors like constantly saying 'no,' claiming everything as 'mine,' and resisting activity transitions. Pediatric psychologists and early childhood educators explain that these actions are developmentally appropriate, serving to build a child's sense of self and independence. For instance, a toddler's 'no' can be an assertion of newfound self-awareness. Experts offer practical parenting tips, such as modeling calm responses, offering positive choices, and teaching problem-solving instead of solely focusing on prohibitions. The article emphasizes that understanding the 'why' behind these behaviors helps parents respond strategically, fostering social and emotional learning rather than power struggles. This provides valuable guidance for navigating the challenges of toddlerhood.</p>

          <p>The search for a new chair of the UK's grooming gang inquiry is expected to take months after two leading candidates withdrew, and four members of the survivors' panel resigned. The resigning panel members accused Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips of 'betrayal' for denying claims that the inquiry's scope might be broadened. The government is determined to keep Phillips in her post, with a second group of survivors supporting her continued involvement. The article highlights the profound difficulty in establishing trust with victims of sexual abuse, who have been repeatedly let down by state agencies. This critical inquiry faces significant challenges in its leadership and maintaining survivor confidence. The Prime Minister has reiterated the inquiry's commitment to examining all aspects of the issue.</p>
