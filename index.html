          <p>The European Parliament, known for its strong stance against China on issues like human rights and trade, is attempting to normalize relations with Beijing after a period of estrangement. President Roberta Metsola has initiated this reset, aiming to re-establish constructive dialogue between the European Parliament and the National People’s Congress. This shift is evidenced by previously unseen correspondence and conversations with parliament insiders, revealing an unexpected thaw in relations. Metsola expressed optimism about revitalizing legislative discussions, marking a significant step toward improved parliamentary relations despite some internal reservations. The move signals a potential shift in the EU's approach to engaging with China on various global issues. Optimism surrounding this shift will be contingent on China's responsiveness and demonstrated commitment to addressing concerns raised by the European Parliament. The tone of this article is relatively neutral, focusing on the factual aspects of the diplomatic shift. </p>

          <p>A major heat wave has descended on eastern North America, leading to dozens of hospitalizations due to heat-related illnesses. In Paterson, New Jersey, over 150 people fell ill at an outdoor school graduation, prompting the mayor to declare a state of emergency and cancel recreational activities. Washington D.C. also saw six people requiring hospital treatment during a concert, and North Carolina reported at least 41 hospitalizations, including children. Heat warnings are in effect across a wide region, impacting more than 160 million people in the US and Canada, with experts warning of increased health risks due to high humidity and prolonged high temperatures. The situation is dire, with the Mid-Atlantic region expected to face the most intense conditions, underscoring the severity of the ongoing heat wave. The heatwave is a serious health concern, especially for vulnerable populations. </p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, advocating for international collaboration on trade despite rising tariffs and global barriers. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and urged against politicizing trade or using it for security concerns. Li called for reshaping international rules and order through engagement in the international economy, advocating for countries to keep to the "right" path. Columbia University professor Adam Tooze noted the "interesting" comment on reshaping rules, suggesting a pluralization of the global order. The premier's remarks come at a time of heightened tensions, including those between the U.S. and China, and the Israel-Iran conflict. The general sentiment is that China is trying to assert itself as a global economic leader and advocate for cooperation. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers have reached a tentative agreement on a $321 billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing housing reform proposals. The deal aims to address a $12 billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funds. The budget reflects resistance to Newsom's proposed cuts, with lawmakers prioritizing compassion and fiscal responsibility amid uncertainty about the state's financial problems. The agreement includes a housing caveat, requiring CEQA exemptions for building projects, and adjustments to Medi-Cal funding, including premium requirements for undocumented immigrants. This budget deal is expected to be a precursor to more challenging financial discussions in the coming months. </p>

          <p>Despite recent US strikes on Iran's key nuclear facilities, the US and Iran are reportedly considering restarting nuclear negotiations. A preliminary US intelligence assessment suggests that the strikes may have only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months. This assessment contradicts assertions that the strikes "fully obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. The White House has refuted these assessments, maintaining that the strikes resulted in "total obliteration." The extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities remains unclear, but the possibility of renewed negotiations suggests a potential path toward de-escalation. </p>

This was his first multi-hit game since late May and his first with multiple extra-base hits since mid-May, raising questions about whether this is a turning point for him. Despite his struggles this season, the Dodgers have remained optimistic about Conforto's potential, and this performance could impact the team's roster construction for the second half of the season. Conforto's success against fastballs in this game suggests a possible return to form. This performance is a positive sign for Conforto and the Dodgers, potentially reducing the need to seek a replacement at the trade deadline. </p>

          <p>China is actively promoting the use of the yuan by foreign institutions, capitalizing on a perceived decline in international confidence in the U.S. dollar. These efforts include establishing a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Beijing is also expanding the range of tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and considering allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan. Despite these efforts, some experts argue that China needs to address concerns about capital controls and geopolitical risks to become a more dependable alternative to the U.S. dollar. While the yuan's global usage remains low, China's ongoing efforts signal a long-term strategy to challenge the dollar's dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing Democrat, has conceded victory to Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant political upset. Cuomo, the former governor, was attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani's victory indicates a potential shift in the Democratic Party's direction. The results showed Mamdani with a commanding lead, although he fell short of the 50% threshold needed to win outright, making Cuomo's concession unexpected. The former governor's loss marks the "biggest upset in modern NYC history", demonstrating a desire among New York Democrats for leaders who fight with enthusiasm and courage. </p>

          <p>Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies reveals significant damage to key Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, following US airstrikes. The images show craters along access roads and at tunnel entrances at Fordow, and destruction at the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center. At Natanz, craters believed to be caused by US ordnance are filled and covered with dirt. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that key buildings and underground systems at all three sites were hit. American officials claim that Iran’s nuclear program has been severely set back as a result of the strikes. </p>

          <p>The New York City Democratic mayoral primary is a battle between left-wing outsider Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has gained support with a focus on affordability, while Cuomo, despite a sexual harassment scandal, is seen as the moderate establishment candidate. The race is viewed as a proxy war between the left and moderates within the Democratic Party. Mamdani's campaign has generated significant grassroots excitement, but critics question his experience. Cuomo emphasizes his experience and ability to deal with Trump and Washington, while Mamdani argues that voters want a focus on affordability. </p>

DiamondCDN was linked to a website run by a cybercrime ring, raising concerns about Coristine's past activities.

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, but the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the facilities, ranging from a few months to less than a year. The White House has disputed these findings, while current and former national security officials have expressed concerns about leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities. A classified briefing for Congress on the administration's actions in Iran has been scheduled. </p>
