          <h2>Trump's Actions Echo Past Corruption, But Aren't Entirely New, Says Essayist</h2>

          <p>Casey Michel argues in this New York Times article that while President Trump's foreign dealings are brazen, they are not unprecedented. The article highlights the Trump family's various ventures, such as the Executive Branch club and cryptocurrency deals, aimed at profiting from the presidency. It draws parallels to past administrations, including the Clinton Foundation, which accepted funds from foreign regimes. The author notes that Trump has dismantled counter-kleptocracy measures, but also points out that American politicians have long been susceptible to foreign influence. The article concludes by urging Congress to pass legislation preventing former politicians and their families from engaging in foreign lobbying and deals.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the revitalized sleeper train network in Europe with the declining state of long-distance rail travel in the United States in this New York Times article. Europe's focus on climate-friendly travel and investment in high-speed rail contrasts with America's car-centric culture and underfunded rail infrastructure. The article highlights the correlation between car dependence and decreased happiness in American drivers. It criticizes America's tendency to invest in unproven transportation technologies instead of improving existing rail systems. The article advocates for revitalized railways in the U.S. to promote community, connection, and a shared sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>This article details the investigation into the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis, where a key piece of evidence was bloody, bare footprints left at the crime scene. The footprints, combined with DNA evidence, eventually led investigators to Jerry Westrom, who was convicted of the murder in 2022. The article describes how forensic scientists used genetic genealogy to identify Westrom as a suspect and how footprint analysis confirmed his presence at the scene. Despite Westrom's denial and the presence of other DNA at the scene, the jury found him guilty, bringing closure to a decades-long search for justice.</p>

The changes aim to address a $12 billion deficit attributed to tariffs and rising healthcare costs. While Newsom claims he won't remove anyone from Medi-Cal, the plan would suspend access to comprehensive services for undocumented adults over 19 and charge others $100 monthly, potentially saving the state $5.4 billion by 2028-29.</p>

          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared an "intentional act of terrorism" by the FBI, resulting in one death and multiple injuries. The blast, which occurred near American Reproductive Centers, caused significant damage to nearby buildings and prompted evacuations in Twentynine Palms. The FBI has identified a person of interest and assures the public there is no ongoing threat. The clinic confirmed that its staff and stored embryos are unharmed, and investigations are underway involving the FBI, ATF, and local authorities.</p>

          <p>Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, calling them "absolute losers" and feeling "incredibly betrayed." He argues that allowing AI firms to use artists' content without payment is "theft, thievery on a high scale." The government rejected proposals to force AI companies to disclose the material they use, prompting John to warn that this will "rob young people of their legacy and their income." He is prepared to take ministers to court if the plans are not changed, with other artists and industry leaders echoing his concerns.</p>

          <p>This New York Times news analysis examines how India's ongoing conflict with Pakistan, despite being a military draw, strategically sets back India's aspirations as a global power. The article points out that the conflict equates India with Pakistan, a smaller nation accused of sponsoring terrorism, and limits India's ability to resolve long-standing disputes. Religious nationalism and power politics further complicate the situation. The piece concludes that while India has built diplomatic power, it must find a way to coexist with its neighbor to fully achieve its global ambitions.</p>

While the establishment of the Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine is a positive step, Putin's immunity and the rejection of international jurisdiction by autocratic allies and powerful states hinder its effectiveness. The article notes that democratic states often undermine international law, making it difficult to enforce. Despite some victories, the author concludes that moral confusion among political leaders and a lack of respect for law undermine human societies.</p>
