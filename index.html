          <p>Dick Barnett, a key player for the New York Knicks during their championship years in the 1970s, has died at the age of 88 in Largo, Florida. Known for his distinctive jump shot, Barnett was instrumental in the Knicks' only two NBA championship victories. The Knicks organization announced his death, which occurred overnight in an assisted living facility, shortly after a playoff victory against the Detroit Pistons.

          <p>Japan and Vietnam have agreed to establish a vice-ministerial-level foreign affairs and defense dialogue and collaborate on defense equipment and technology, signaling a strengthened security partnership amid concerns over China's increasing military presence in the region.

This move could make Vietnam the fourth recipient of Japan's Official Security Assistance scheme, aimed at bolstering the security capabilities of like-minded nations in Southeast Asia.

          <p>The trial has commenced in Newcastle Crown Court for two men accused of intentionally cutting down the famous Sycamore Gap tree, a beloved landmark along Hadrian's Wall in northern England. Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers have pleaded not guilty to charges of criminal damage, with the tree valued at over £620,000 and damage to the ancient wall estimated at £1,100. The felling of the tree, which gained fame from its appearance in the film 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,' caused widespread dismay, and the trial is expected to draw significant public attention.</p>

Washington asserts its actions aim to end the threat the Iran-backed Houthis pose to shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, while the Houthis maintain they are acting in support of Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>

          <p>The US dollar's recent weakness, fueled by President Trump's global trade policies, has created an opportunity for the euro to attract investors seeking stability. Market volatility, marked by simultaneous sell-offs of the dollar, American stocks, and Treasury bonds, has prompted some European officials to highlight the predictability and respect for the rule of law within the European Union. This has led to increased investor interest in euro-denominated assets, as uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's trade approach persists.</p>

          <p>Experts in child development and mental health are alerting UK MPs to the profound and lasting impact of verbal abuse on children's brains, leading to increased risks of mental ill-health and difficulties in forming friendships. Verbal abuse can reshape brain structures, particularly in areas related to threat and reward processing, causing children to perceive the world as more dangerous. Studies show that sustained exposure to verbal abuse can alter brain function, making children more prone to misinterpreting social cues and withdrawing from interactions. Researchers emphasize the urgent need to address verbal abuse as a preventable cause of mental health problems.</p>

          <p>U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's capital, Sanaa, have reportedly killed at least eight people, according to Houthi rebels, while the U.S. military acknowledges conducting over 800 strikes in a month-long campaign. U.S. Central Command claims these strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders, particularly those involved in missile and drone programs. The U.S. justifies the strikes as necessary to protect shipping in the Red Sea and deter attacks on Israel, accusing Iran of supporting the Houthis. The Houthis have tightened control over information, restricting access to Starlink satellite internet terminals.</p>

          <p>Despite political headwinds and supply chain challenges, the US wind energy industry is finding new opportunities in 'repowering' aging wind farms. As many turbines reach the end of their lifecycle, operators are choosing to upgrade or replace them with more efficient models, boosting electricity output. This repowering activity is benefiting market leaders like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. While new onshore wind farm growth has slowed, repowering offers economic benefits, including avoiding the need for new property acquisition and increasing energy output with fewer, more efficient turbines.</p>
