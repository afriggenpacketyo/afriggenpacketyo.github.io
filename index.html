        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has withdrawn Jared Isaacman's nomination to head NASA, just days before a Senate confirmation vote. President Trump announced the decision via Truth Social, stating that he would soon announce a new nominee aligned with his "America First" agenda. Isaacman, a private astronaut with ties to SpaceX, had previously expressed his commitment to advancing space exploration. Musk responded to the withdrawal by writing, "It is rare to find someone so competent and good-hearted." The White House spokeswoman did not give a reason as to why the nomination was withdrawn. The article suggests this move reflects Trump's desire for complete alignment with his administration's goals for space exploration. Optimism surrounding NASA's leadership is tempered by the sudden change in direction.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how George Wendt, best known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," inadvertently embroiled himself in Ohio politics during John Boehner's first congressional race in 1990. Wendt, campaigning for his brother-in-law Greg Jolivette, mistakenly conflated Boehner with another politician involved in a sexual scandal on national television. Boehner's team responded, accusing Jolivette of cheap politics, and Boehner himself criticized Wendt for his remarks. Despite the gaffe, Boehner won the election and later became Speaker of the House. The article details the incident and Boehner's reaction, reflecting on the intersection of celebrity and politics. The article illustrates how a humorous incident became a memorable part of Boehner's early political career.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a truck carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities urged the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away, especially those allergic to bee stings. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue effort, aiming to save as many bees as possible and help them re-hive. The road was closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the bee recovery operation. The situation was eventually brought under control, with most bees expected to return to their hives by morning.</p>

The level of NHS spending will determine potential cuts to other unprotected areas. Despite increased funding in 2024, spending will slow down, requiring difficult decisions. Chancellor Reeves' stance against borrowing more money and raising taxes intensifies speculation about spending cuts. The IFS suggests a huge amount depends on the generosity of cash handed to the NHS, potentially pulling funding from other areas.

          <p>A TikTok trend promoting a "McMigraine Meal" (Coke and fries) as a migraine cure has gone viral, but experts caution against its effectiveness. While some individuals find temporary relief from the caffeine and salt, medical professionals emphasize that migraines are complex neurological conditions not cured by fast food. Too much caffeine can be a trigger, and fast food can contain compounds that exacerbate migraines. Neurologists recommend lifestyle changes and stress the importance of consulting medical professionals for appropriate treatments.
