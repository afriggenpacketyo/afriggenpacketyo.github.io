          <p>Scientists and epidemiologists are expressing alarm over President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s claims linking prenatal Tylenol use and childhood vaccines to autism. Researchers, whose work was cited by the White House, clarified that Tylenol's potential association with autism, if any, would be minimal, and rigorous studies refute vaccine links. Experts from the CDC were not consulted for the White House announcement, which critics fear will lead people to avoid safe medications and vaccines, while undermining credible scientific research. This article highlights the potential public health risks of such misleading statements.</p>

          <p>International health organizations and experts have strongly refuted President Trump's assertion that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of autism. The European Medicines Agency, UK's MHRA, and Australia's TGA all stated there is no new or robust scientific evidence supporting such a causal link. Spain's Health Minister criticized Trump for spreading misinformation, while a major study in Sweden tracking 2.5 million children found no increased risk. This article underscores the widespread international rejection of the White House's claims, emphasizing the safety of acetaminophen for pregnant women.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office has condemned President Trump's "bigoted" comments at the UN General Assembly, where Trump falsely suggested London was moving towards sharia law and had "changed" under Khan's leadership. Trump's remarks echoed far-right conspiracy theories linking Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, to Islamic fundamentalism, despite no evidence. The Mayor's office asserted London is a safe, welcoming city, and several British politicians defended Khan. This article highlights the ongoing contentious relationship between Trump and Khan, and the political backlash against Trump's comments.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Ryan Routh guilty on all five charges, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Routh, who represented himself, reportedly attempted to stab himself with a pen after the verdict was read, requiring intervention from U.S. marshals. Prosecutors argued Routh had meticulously planned to kill Trump, despite Routh's claims of no intent to fire his weapon. This article details the dramatic courtroom events and the severity of the charges, marking the second assassination attempt against Trump in 2024.</p>

          <p>President Trump returned to the UN General Assembly, delivering a speech that underscored a dramatic shift in his relationship with the world, moving from being mocked to being taken seriously. His address emphasized an "America First" doctrine, criticizing climate change efforts, immigration, and global alliances, while touting his role as a peacemaker despite escalating conflicts. Trump's stance on Ukraine also evolved, stating Kyiv could win back territory with European support, a departure from previous calls for territorial concessions.

While Trump criticized Putin and called Russia a "paper tiger," his statements lacked concrete action items for increasing US support for Ukraine.
