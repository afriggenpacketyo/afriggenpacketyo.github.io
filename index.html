          <p>Donald Trump expressed his anger at Vladimir Putin for undermining Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's credibility during ceasefire negotiations.  Trump threatened to impose significant tariffs on countries purchasing Russian oil if a ceasefire isn't reached, marking a departure from his previous pro-Putin stance.
