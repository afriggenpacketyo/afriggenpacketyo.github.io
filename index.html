          <p>Scientists and medical researchers are voicing alarm over layoffs and budget cuts initiated by the Trump administration, which they argue are jeopardizing crucial progress in finding a cure for cancer. The article highlights that cancer research, once a subject of strong bipartisan support, is now facing significant financial reductions. It also features the perspectives of cancer patients participating in clinical trials, whose potential treatments and contributions to research are now at risk due to the funding shortfalls, politicizing what has long been a united public health effort.</p>

          <p>An audio diary from Hanya Aljamal, a 28-year-old teacher in Deir al-Balah, provides a poignant look at daily life in war-torn Gaza. Displaced multiple times and now living with her family in a small apartment, she describes the struggle to find purpose and meaning as her world collapses. Her account captures the constant fear from nearby explosions, the psychological torture of drones, and the profound sense of loss for her former life, friends, and students. Amid the destruction, she finds small acts of resistance and hope, like watching a neighbor tend his garden.</p>

          <p>A mother, identified as Emma, has resorted to illegally purchasing vapes for her two teenage children in an effort to control their severe nicotine addiction. She feels this is the only way to ensure the products are from reputable sources and to wean them down to lower nicotine levels, after her son experienced serious health issues. The article explores the broader issue of youth vaping, noting that a recent ban on disposable vapes has had little effect.

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip have resulted in at least 72 Palestinian deaths, according to health officials in the region. The attacks targeted various locations, including a stadium sheltering displaced people in Gaza City and a tent camp in Muwasi where a family was killed. These events occurred as President Trump announced a potential ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached within the next week. The administration has been pushing for a pause in the 21-month-long conflict, though recent proposals have yet to be accepted by both sides.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered mysterious, ancient radio waves that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth, originating from the distant galaxy cluster SpARCS1049. These signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. Researchers theorize these halos are formed either by particles ejected from supermassive black holes or by cosmic particle collisions. The discovery suggests that these powerful energetic processes have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers losing 9-5 to the Kansas City Royals, pitcher Shohei Ohtani delivered his best performance of the season from the mound. In two innings, he threw 20 strikes out of 27 pitches and recorded the hardest-thrown pitch of his career at 101.7 mph. Ohtani's dominant but limited outing, part of his recovery from a second Tommy John surgery, demonstrated his powerful potential. However, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled after his departure, and the offense was unable to capitalize on opportunities, leading to the end of their five-game winning streak.</p>

While the U.S. maintains a significant lead in AI chip technology, a gap Shum believes will take years to close, China is making major strides in algorithmic efficiency. He cited the Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which achieved results comparable to top American competitors like OpenAI using a fraction of the computing power.

The woman was in waist-deep water when she was bitten on her left leg and foot but did not see what attacked her. After examining photos of the non-life-threatening wounds, experts concluded the bites were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Swimming was temporarily suspended at the beach, but a drone search for the shark was unsuccessful and activities resumed the following day.</p>

          <p>The Senate's version of a major Republican spending bill aims to make several of President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lower income-tax brackets and a larger child tax credit. The 940-page bill also proposes new temporary tax breaks and would raise the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for many households. The legislation has faced internal Republican dissent over its proposed $5 trillion debt ceiling increase and deep cuts to Medicaid. Lawmakers are pushing to pass the bill before the July 4th holiday.</p>

          <p>A mudslide triggered by heavy rains caused a major traffic shutdown on the West Virginia Turnpike, leaving thousands of motorists stranded overnight for more than eight hours. The slide blocked a storm drain, flooding the northbound lanes and creating a 12-mile backup with no detour provided. The West Virginia Parkways Authority took full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic and pledged to revise its emergency procedures. No injuries were reported, but stranded drivers expressed frustration over the lack of information, food, and water during the ordeal.</p>

          <p>Clashes erupted in Serbia's capital, Belgrade, as anti-government protesters demanding early elections and the end of President Aleksandar Vucic's rule confronted police. Officers in riot gear deployed pepper spray after demonstrators, led by students, marched toward a counter-protest held by Vucic supporters. The protests were initially sparked by a deadly train station collapse last year, which was blamed on government negligence. Vucic has rejected calls for a snap election and accused foreign powers of fueling the months-long demonstrations, which have been driven largely by university students.</p>

The increased use of plainclothes and masked agents by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump administration may be making it easier for imposters to operate. Experts warn this practice poses a public safety threat, as it becomes difficult for the public to distinguish between legitimate law enforcement and criminals.

This indicates that men may have moved into their wives' households upon marriage, and female offspring remained connected to their family buildings. The findings are supported by a pattern of preferential treatment, with females receiving five times more grave goods than males.</p>

          <p>Concerns over press freedom in Kenya are escalating after a government crackdown on nationwide anti-government protests that left 19 dead. Security forces reportedly used live ammunition, and the government's communications authority attempted to ban live media coverage of the demonstrations, an order that was quickly revoked by judges. The protests, largely driven by Gen Z youth, are fueled by economic hardship and dissatisfaction with President William Ruto's government. Journalists and activists report being targeted, raising fears of a shrinking space for dissent and free expression.</p>

          <p>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) held a party congress to bid farewell to former Chancellor Olaf Scholz and reassess its direction following a poor showing in recent elections. In his farewell speech, Scholz defended his government's policies and warned against illusions about Vladimir Putin's expansionist plans in Ukraine. The congress also saw the re-election of Lars Klingbeil as co-leader, though with significantly reduced support, and the election of BÃ¤rbel Bas as the new co-chair. The event marks a pivotal moment for the center-left party as it navigates its future in opposition.</p>
