        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deadly explosion outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, killed one person and injured at least four others, shattering windows and scattering debris across several blocks. Authorities believe the clinic was specifically targeted, though the motive remains unclear. The New York Times article highlights the political context surrounding in vitro fertilization (IVF) and reproductive rights, adding complexity to the investigation. The clinic confirmed that its staff and reproductive materials were unharmed and that it plans to reopen on Monday. The FBI and ATF are assisting local law enforcement in the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Michael Gove, a former Conservative minister, stated that another Scottish independence referendum could occur if there's overwhelming public support. He emphasized that the UK government might reconsider its stance if the Scottish National Party's popularity and demand for another vote increase significantly. Gove underscored the importance of continually demonstrating the benefits of the union to maintain confidence. He also noted that the SNP's ability to improve public services could influence the likelihood of a second referendum. This BBC article highlights a surprising alignment between Gove and SNP leader John Swinney, who both suggest independence should proceed only with substantial public backing.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have had their sentences reduced, now including the possibility of parole, as detailed in this BBC article. This shift comes amid growing public sympathy fueled by new evidence of alleged sexual abuse and greater understanding of trauma. The brothers' claims of abuse, once dismissed, are now viewed with more empathy, partly due to increased awareness from TikTok, Netflix, and celebrity advocacy. The decision now rests with California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom, who must consider the evolving public sentiment alongside his political ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but with new restrictions limiting its use to older adults and individuals with pre-existing conditions that increase their risk from COVID-19. This decision, detailed in the New York Times article, reflects growing skepticism towards vaccines and requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects, potentially costing the company millions. Experts express concerns that these limitations may reduce vaccine accessibility and options for those seeking it for various reasons, including protecting vulnerable family members. The move marks a departure from previous norms where the CDC typically determined vaccine eligibility, leading to confusion and criticism regarding the FDA's motives.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging Chicago into near-zero visibility on Friday, as reported by the New York Times. The National Weather Service issued its first-ever dust storm warning for the city, triggered by strong winds lifting dry soil from drought-stricken farmland. The storm, described as a haboob, created hazardous driving conditions and evoked memories of the Dust Bowl era. Meteorologists noted the exceptionally dry soil conditions as a key factor in the storm's formation, highlighting the severity of the drought in the region.</p>
