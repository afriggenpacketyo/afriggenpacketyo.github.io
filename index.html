          <p>Alaska Airlines requested a temporary, system-wide ground stop for all its flights and those of its partner, Horizon Air, due to a significant IT outage on Sunday evening. The airline acknowledged the disruption and apologized to passengers for the inconvenience, warning of residual operational impacts throughout the night. Travelers were advised to check their flight status before heading to the airport as the company worked to resolve the technical issue. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the ground stop request, highlighting the widespread effect of the system failure.</p>

          <p>Florida has scheduled the August 19 execution of Kayle Bates, a 67-year-old man convicted for the 1982 kidnapping and murder of 24-year-old Janet White. Bates was found guilty of abducting White from her workplace, attempting to sexually assault her, and then fatally stabbing her before stealing her ring. The execution warrant was signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, marking the 10th scheduled execution in the state for the year. Despite recent failed appeals to the Florida and U.S. Supreme Courts, Bates' attorney plans to file further appeals, arguing the execution would be unconstitutional.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new provision will require most nonimmigrant visa applicants to the U.S. to pay a 'visa integrity fee' of at least $250, in addition to existing application fees. This fee, part of the Trump administration's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' is intended to enhance immigration system integrity and is set to begin in the 2025 fiscal year. While the fee is paid upon visa issuance and is potentially reimbursable if visa conditions are met, implementation details remain unclear, causing confusion for travel associations and immigration lawyers. Critics worry the additional cost could deter tourists and international students. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the 44-year-old brother of the late NFL player and Army Ranger Pat Tillman, was arrested following a fire that destroyed a post office in San Jose, California. Authorities allege that Richard intentionally reversed a vehicle into the building's lobby early Sunday morning and then set it on fire. Investigators also found the phrase 'Viva La Me' spray-painted on the building, though its meaning is unclear. The motive for the incident is still under investigation, and the attack has left the community with more questions than answers, given the Tillman family's respected but tragic history.</p>

Despite the significant setback, Ishiba has stated he has no intention of resigning, attributing the 'harsh result' to voter frustration over rising prices and trade tensions with the U.S. The defeat undermines the coalition's legislative power and reflects dissatisfaction with Ishiba's leadership and a series of political scandals.

          <p>A new class of drugs known as GLP-1s, including the active ingredients in Ozempic and Wegovy, are being explored as a groundbreaking treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance, have reported significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and hair loss after using these medications. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps rebalance hormones. Larger clinical trials are needed, but early results and anecdotal evidence suggest a major therapeutic breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Canada is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 cases in 2025, a figure that far surpasses that of the much larger United States. The surge has placed Canada among the top 10 countries with measles outbreaks globally, with Alberta being the hardest-hit province. Health officials link the spread to declining vaccination rates, particularly in the wake of post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Outbreaks have been prominent in some Low German-speaking Mennonite communities, but the issue is widespread, highlighting a broader public health challenge in a country where the disease was declared eliminated in 1998.</p>

          <p>In this market commentary, the author argues against the conventional wisdom that looming tariffs will harm the stock market, particularly highly valued tech stocks. The article lists ten positive factors that are currently buoying the market, including strong corporate earnings and numerous economic stimulus provisions within President Trump's 'big beautiful bill.' These provisions, such as tax cut extensions, a new deduction for tipped workers, and an increased child tax credit, are expected to inject hundreds of billions into the economy. The author suggests these tailwinds, along with other factors like infrastructure spending and deregulation, create a strong foundation for continued market growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that people retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly boosted. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to find solutions. The warning comes as new analysis reveals stark gaps in pension savings, with nearly half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed, low earners, women, and some ethnic minorities, not contributing to a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a future strategy to avert the looming retirement income shortfall.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals a growing divide between President Trump's political base and the rest of the country, with his overall approval sliding. Public support for his administration's deportation program has fallen to a net-negative rating, as most Americans now believe it is not focused on dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. Economically, a large majority feels the administration is not doing enough to lower prices, which remains their top concern. The poll also found that most Americans disapprove of the recently passed 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' believing it primarily benefits the wealthy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' recent struggles continued as they lost 6-5 to the Milwaukee Brewers, completing a season sweep and marking their tenth loss in twelve games. The team's frustrating day was compounded by a potentially significant injury to first baseman Freddie Freeman, who was hit by a pitch on his left wrist. While initial X-rays were negative, the injury adds to the team's woes, which include defensive errors and a slumping offense. The loss sealed the first season series sweep of more than four games against the Dodgers in two decades, leaving players and management searching for answers.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now billions over budget and years behind schedule, was destined for problems due to fundamental challenges in building major infrastructure in the country, according to insiders. The article suggests that building on a 'small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island' creates inherent obstacles. The project's initial ambition for world-leading speed and frequency drove up costs, while the complex planning and legal systems allowed for thousands of expensive changes and delays to appease local and political interests. This has led to questions about whether the UK's entire approach to such mega-projects is flawed.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will launch a national inquiry into the 'Battle of Orgreave,' one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident on June 18, 1984, involved violent clashes between thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners, which collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had 'unanswered questions for over 40 years,' and the inquiry aims to finally uncover the truth.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since the peak of Tiger Woods, drawing frequent comparisons from peers and commentators. By winning his fourth major, Scheffler has demonstrated a 'Tiger-like' consistency and an unerring ability to close out tournaments from a leading position. While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons 'silly,' his machine-like performance, unflappable demeanor, and statistical superiority from tee to green mark a new era of supremacy in the sport. A key improvement in his putting has transformed him from a top contender into an almost unbeatable force.</p>
