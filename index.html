          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is threatening immediate legal action against Apple over alleged antitrust violations in its App Store. Musk claims that Apple's policies make it impossible for any AI company other than OpenAI to achieve top rankings, specifically citing the placement of his Grok AI chatbot. This follows a history of tension, including Musk's criticism of Apple's OS-level integration of OpenAI technology, which he deemed an unacceptable security risk. The conflict highlights the intensifying competition and legal battles within the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry.</p>

          <p>In a trial challenging the legality of President Trump's 2020 National Guard deployment in Los Angeles, a key general testified he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion," a term the administration used for legal justification. The lawsuit, brought by California's governor, questions if the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military for law enforcement. The testimony casts doubt on the administration's official reasoning for the controversial federal intervention during protests against ICE operations, scrutinizing the basis for the executive action.</p>

          <p>President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force is analyzed within a historical context of politicians using racist narratives to justify aggressive policing in majority non-white cities. Critics and civil rights advocates argue the move echoes past "law and order" campaigns that targeted Black communities and undermined local governance. They express concern that this action, framed as a response to a public safety crisis, could violate civil liberties and set a precedent for federal intervention in other cities with progressive, non-white leadership.</p>

          <p>A former Los Angeles police reserve officer has been charged in a home invasion and subsequent kidnapping for ransom. Prosecutors allege that while still an active reserve officer, he and accomplices handcuffed two victims in a Koreatown apartment and forced one to transfer $200,000 in cryptocurrency. The former officer, who now faces a potential life sentence for the violent crime, was already facing separate charges for insurance fraud.

          <p>England is bracing for peak heatwave temperatures, with amber health alerts issued for southern and central regions due to potential strain on health services and travel disruption. Temperatures are expected to reach up to 34°C (93°F). Simultaneously, a national drought group has warned that the country is suffering from "nationally significant" water shortfalls. The lack of water is impacting crop yields, livestock, and river wildlife, highlighting the dual environmental pressures of extreme heat and prolonged drought conditions facing the nation.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is publicly calling on President Trump to abandon a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in Texas. Newsom warned that if the Texas plan proceeds, California is prepared to retaliate by redrawing its own maps to create more Democratic-leaning seats, escalating a "redistricting arms race." The standoff began when Texas Democrats fled the state to block a vote on the new map, which aims to flip five Democratic-held seats and secure a GOP house majority in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and has placed the city's Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control, citing a need to crack down on crime. The president declared it "liberation day in D.C.," framing the move as a rescue from "bloodshed, bedlam and squalor." D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the unprecedented action "unsettling," while critics pointed to data showing a recent decline in violent crime in the city, questioning the premise of the federal takeover.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is expanding "safe passage" zones around at least 100 schools in response to deep fears among immigrant families about federal raids. The move was announced after an incident where immigration agents reportedly detained a 15-year-old student at gunpoint outside a high school in a case of mistaken identity. School officials and community volunteers will patrol areas to ensure student safety, reflecting a citywide effort to reassure families that schools will remain a protected environment during a period of heightened anxiety.</p>

          <p>In the canals of Xochimilco, Mexico City, scientists are now using environmental DNA (eDNA) to search for the critically endangered axolotl salamander. With the population having plummeted from an estimated 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014, traditional net surveys often come up empty. By filtering water and testing for genetic traces, researchers can detect the elusive creature's presence. This modern technique offers a new way to monitor the species and highlights the urgent need for habitat restoration to save the iconic amphibian.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's military has announced that a joint air and ground operation in the northwestern state of Zamfara resulted in the deaths of more than 100 armed gang members. The operation targeted a large group of so-called "bandits" who were allegedly preparing to attack a village. These armed groups have been terrorizing communities in the region for years, engaging in mass kidnappings for ransom and other violent crimes. The military action is part of ongoing efforts to quell the widespread violence and instability affecting central and northwest Nigeria.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic characterizes President Trump's federal takeover of the D.C. police and National Guard deployment as an authoritarian action based on a false premise. The article argues that Trump is using outdated crime statistics to justify the move, which serves as a public relations stunt and sets a dangerous precedent for federal intervention in U.S. cities. Critics note the irony of Trump's supporters, who once decried a "police state" under Democrats, now backing this seizure of local power, which undermines the district's home rule.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer commented on the Trump administration's deal requiring Nvidia and AMD to give the government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China. Cramer argued the move is not novel, but is essentially "just another form of tariff," with the money going to the U.S. Treasury. While acknowledging a debatable "pay-to-play" element, he views the decision to allow the sales as more significant than the revenue cut. He concluded that if the chipmakers are not complaining, the deal is good for them and for taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado is battling several large wildfires, including the Lee fire, which has grown to become the fifth largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres. More than a thousand firefighters are deployed, facing challenging conditions of gusty winds, low humidity, and extremely dry fuels that cause extreme fire behavior. The governor has declared a disaster emergency to support the response efforts, as evacuations are in place for several mountain communities. The blazes are contributing to poor air quality and highlight the explosive start to this year's fire season.</p>
