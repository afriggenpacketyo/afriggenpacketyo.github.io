          <p>Paramount Global has nominated three new directors to its board, including attorney Mary Boies, venture capitalist Charles E. Ryan, and former judge Roanne Sragow Licht, while Judith A. McHale steps down. This move comes as Paramount navigates its potential sale to Skydance Media and defends against a lawsuit filed by President Trump over edits to a "60 Minutes" interview. The lawsuit has caused internal divisions, with Redstone reportedly seeking to settle it to facilitate the FCC's review of the Skydance takeover, which has raised concerns among Democrat senators about potential bribery allegations. The company's top executives received substantial compensation packages, totaling $148 million, amid these challenges.</p>

          <p>French national anti-terror prosecutors are investigating a potential terrorist motive after a man fatally shot his Tunisian neighbor and wounded a Turkish man in Puget-sur-Argens, France. The suspect, a French national, had posted racist videos before and after the shooting, claiming allegiance to the French flag and urging violence against foreigners. This incident follows a stabbing in April at a mosque in southern France, raising concerns about hate crimes against Muslims. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau condemned the murder as a racist act, emphasizing that racism is a poison that kills and is an anti-French act.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly presented a proposal to Iran that would allow limited low-level uranium enrichment to continue within the country for an unspecified period. This proposal includes strict conditions, such as preventing Iran from building new enrichment facilities, dismantling critical infrastructure, and halting research and development on nuclear centrifuges. Iran would also be required to reduce its enrichment concentration to 3% and shut down all underground enrichment facilities for a mutually agreed-upon timeframe. The White House insists that the terms of the deal are tough and designed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The White House has released a new official portrait of President Trump, showcasing a different style compared to the portrait released before his inauguration. The new portrait features deeper shadowing and Trump wearing a red tie, contrasting with the earlier version's brighter illumination and blue tie. The updated portrait will replace the existing official photographs of Trump in federal buildings and offices, and the White House shared a video of the new portrait being hung in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.</p>

          <p>NPR is asking parents to share the songs they sing to their babies, inspired by a Yale University study that found singing to infants lifts their moods and improves their overall well-being. The study indicates that babies who are sung to frequently are generally happier throughout the day. Parents are encouraged to submit recordings of themselves singing to their babies, and submissions may be featured on Morning Edition. The study suggests that any song is beneficial, not just traditional lullabies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly stated during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, leading to confusion among staff. The US hurricane season officially began on Sunday and lasts through November, with forecasts predicting an active season. A Homeland Security spokesperson stated the comment was a joke, but the incident has raised concerns about Richardson's familiarity with FEMA's operations. This comes amid worries about staff cuts and reductions in hurricane preparations, potentially leaving the agency ill-prepared for the upcoming storm season.</p>

          <p>TikTok food sellers are under scrutiny for failing to list allergen information, a violation of UK regulations, the BBC found. Listings on TikTok Shop show snacks and sweets being sold without highlighting the 14 main allergens required to be declared by UK businesses. TikTok has removed some listings brought to its attention, but concerns remain about the platform's ability to ensure food safety and proper labeling. Allergy charities emphasize the need for TikTok to enforce safety standards and for consumers to exercise caution when purchasing food online.</p>

          <p>Police in San Jose have confirmed that the 1978 murder of teacher Diane Peterson was committed by a student, Harry “Nicky” Nickerson, who was seen with a knife bearing the words “Teacher Dear.” The case remained unsolved for 47 years until a relative disclosed Nickerson's confession. Nickerson had been a person of interest early in the investigation, but leads went cold, and he committed suicide in 1993.
