          <p>A massive spending package supported by President Trump cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate following a dramatic, late-night vote. The measure advanced by a narrow 51-49 margin after several Republican holdouts eventually voted in favor, avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The bill now faces further debate, with Democrats planning to have the entire 940-page text read aloud on the Senate floor. Its passage remains uncertain as it must also be approved again by the House, where some Republicans oppose key provisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Leadmill, an iconic music venue in Sheffield, England, has closed its doors after 45 years following a prolonged dispute with its landlords.

The venue hosted legendary bands like Pulp, Oasis, and Arctic Monkeys early in their careers. While the new owners, Electric Group, plan to refurbish and continue operating it as a music venue, many artists and patrons feel a vital piece of the city's history has been lost.</p>

The plan encourages retailers to voluntarily make healthy food more appealing and accessible, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or changes to store layouts. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to improve national health and reduce strain on the NHS. Critics note that healthy food often costs more than unhealthy options and that the success of previous voluntary industry partnerships has been mixed.</p>

Without naming individuals, he appeared to reference past inflammatory comments from both President Donald Trump and Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the phenomenon known as the "urban heat island effect," which causes cities to be significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas. This occurs because dark, hard surfaces like asphalt roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, releasing it slowly as heat. The effect is compounded by a lack of cooling elements like trees and water, as well as waste heat generated by vehicles and air conditioning. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, urban populations are becoming increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat.</p>

The price hike aims to generate necessary revenue to support the zoo's operations and mitigate the impact of budget cuts. Adult tickets will now cost $27, while prices for children and seniors will also see a corresponding increase.</p>

          <p>Following its recent 12-day war with Israel, Iran has intensified a domestic crackdown, marked by a wave of arrests and accelerated executions. This week, three men were hanged on espionage charges that human rights activists claim were baseless and followed unfair trials. With hundreds arrested during the conflict, there is growing fear among Iranians and rights advocates that the regime is using the post-war period to exact revenge on its own people, suppress dissent, and instill fear through what one expert called a "systematic and rigid form of repression."</p>
