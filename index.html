Woodburn's manager confirmed her passing, describing her as kind, caring, charismatic, and strong, while her husband expressed his heartbreak. Tributes have poured in from former co-stars and colleagues, including Aggie MacKenzie, who acknowledged Woodburn's 'tormented soul' and 'deep pain,' and Jedward, who remembered her support during their time on 'Celebrity Big Brother.' Woodburn also made regular appearances on 'Loose Women' and 'This Morning,' often sharing her outspoken views, and her manager confirmed she was an incredibly kind, caring, charismatic and strong person.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting deaths of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, has been arrested following a tip from a witness who spotted him in a field. Boelter is accused of impersonating a police officer to gain access to the victims' homes before shooting them, and authorities found a list of 45 elected officials in his car. In the wake of the tragedy, Minnesota lawmakers are calling for a reduction in dehumanizing political rhetoric and increased civility across party lines. Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan emphasized the need for elected officials to display humanity and reach across the aisle during divisive times, hoping for a more cohesive community.</p>

          <p>Budget retail chain Poundland is set to close 68 stores as part of a restructuring plan following its recent acquisition by US investment firm Gordon Brothers. The closures, along with the potential shutdown of two distribution centers, place over 1,000 jobs at risk, and the company is also seeking rent reductions from landlords, which could lead to an additional 70 store closures. Poundland's managing director, Barry Williams, stated that while the closures are regrettable, they are necessary to secure the future of thousands of jobs and hundreds of stores, as the company's performance has fallen short of expectations. The restructuring plan requires court approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing heavily in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies that could potentially replace traditional chemotherapy. ADCs are designed to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells and reducing harsh side effects, and while challenges remain, some ADCs have shown the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. These companies are working to overcome issues such as premature release of the chemotherapy payload and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target, and ADCs could account for a significant portion of the worldwide cancer market in the coming years, offering a more precise and effective approach to cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>A nighttime Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv resulted in the deaths of at least 14 people, including a U.S. citizen, and injured over 130 others, according to Ukrainian officials. The main barrage centered on Kyiv, demolishing a nine-story residential building and destroying dozens of apartments, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as 'pure terrorism.' The intensified long-range strikes have coincided with a Russian summer offensive on eastern and northeastern sections of the front line, and Zelenskyy is urging Western partners for more military support as uncertainty about U.S. policy on the war fuels doubts about how much help Kyiv can count on.</p>

The ban, which has been implemented in stops and starts since the Taliban seized power in 2021, is based on the Taliban's hardline interpretation of Islam. Chess players express confusion over the claim that chess is a form of gambling, noting that no betting takes place in official games or informal play, and the international chess federation is moving carefully to try to repeal the ban, hoping the Taliban will see that their suspension makes them "an outlier."</p>

The Institute for National Security Studies estimates that Israel intercepted approximately 95% of the ballistic missiles launched toward its territory, and the U.S. deployed its Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery (THAAD) to Israel to enhance its defensive capabilities. Despite the effectiveness of Israel's defenses, some Iranian missiles have hit civilian population centers, causing casualties and disruptions, and the expert believes the longer the conflict continues, the more militarily neutered the Islamic Republic will become.</p>

Israel expanded its aerial assault on Iran, targeting not only nuclear and military facilities but also the regime-controlled media, and the attacks have sent thousands of Iranians racing to try to evacuate major cities.</p>

Red Bull lodged a protest claiming Russell drove 'erratically' behind the safety car, but it was rejected by the stewards, and Wolff told Sky Sports at the New York premiere of F1 that it took team Red Bull Racing two hours before they launched the protest, so that was in their doing. Red Bull boss Christian Horner suggested he had no regrets lodging a complaint, stating it's a team's right to do so.</p>

Kennedy Jr., for the food industry to pull back on artificial dyes as part of a larger so-called Make America Healthy Again platform. The FDA in April announced a plan to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year and replace them with natural alternatives, and Kraft Heinz said it has made more than 1,000 recipe changes over the past five years to improve product nutrition.</p>

Obama's administration deported 438,421 people in 2013 through strategies like increasing penalties for unauthorized border crossings and deputizing local law enforcement. Trump's efforts to replicate Obama's strategy have been stymied by factors such as fewer people crossing the border and increased opposition to cooperating with federal immigration authorities in liberal enclaves, and Trump has launched workplace immigration raids and mobilized federal resources to identify and arrest undocumented immigrants.</p>

It notes that the scarcity alone does not imply that buyers will actually bid more to secure the asset, but it does anchor the bullish math quite strongly, and hitting $1 million implies a $17 trillion market cap, which is about the size of today's existing gold stock.
